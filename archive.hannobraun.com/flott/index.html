    <p><strong class="why">Developing motion control software in Rust should be easy!</strong> Flott aims to make this a reality, by providing libraries that abstract over hardware commonly used for motion control, like motors, encoders, and other sensors and actuators.</p>
<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>
<p>It's still early days for Flott, and work to build up the ecosystem is ongoing. So far, the following libraries are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/flott-motion/stepper">Stepper</a> - Universal Stepper Motor Interface</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/flott-motion/ramp-maker">RampMaker</a> - Stepper Acceleration Ramp Generator</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Long-term, Flott aims to become a comprehensive toolkit that covers all common motion control needs.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>While Flott is focused on building up infrastructure, applications that demonstrate and assist in testing that infrastructure are also within scope. So far, one application exists:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/flott-motion/stepper-terminal">Stepper Terminal</a> - Manual Testing Tool for Stepper</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
<p>The development of Flott is guided by the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open source, permissive license</strong>: Whether you use Flott for a hobby project or something you are going to sell, there won't be any legal restrictions standing in your way.</li>
<li><strong>Open community</strong>: Everyone is welcome to contribute to Flott. Its creator accepts funding and wants to work on it full-time, but the project's policy is to promote all project maintainers that want to do this.</li>
<li><strong>Portable</strong>: If you want to position a tool at specific coordinates, then write code to do just that. Whether using stepper or linear motors, open- or closed-loop control, a gantry mill or a delta robot; your code stays the same. Write your code once, and adapt to changes in the hardware by re-arranging and re-configuring the building blocks provided by Flott.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible</strong>: Replace the code that generates acceleration ramps with your own implementation, or reach down to access the unique features of a specific stepper driver. Whenever you need to leave the beaten path, Flott won't stand in your way.</li>
<li><strong>Portable, again</strong>: Flott is designed to run on microcontrollers, with little to no overhead. But the abstract interfaces it builds on can be implemented for all kinds of platforms, large or small.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
<p>If you're getting value out of Flott, please consider supporting us financially. Your sponsorship helps to keep the project healthy and moving forward.</p>
