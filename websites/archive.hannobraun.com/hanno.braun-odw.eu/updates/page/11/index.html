    <p>I have a daily habit of working on side projects, and I've come to appreciate the benefits of tracking that habit out in the open. If I'm doing work on a software project, I track that <a href="https://github.com/hannobraun" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. If it's more hands-on, I like to post an update here.</p>

<p>I printed some parts for a friend last week: a mold for a concrete planter (<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4728814" target="_blank">files downloaded from Thingiverse</a>).</p>

<p>The parts I printed were a slightly modified remix, but the version was made by Alexandre Chappel. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBX42ZZNQas" target="_blank">video about this</a> is interesting!</p>

</div>
<p>I've printed the first prototype of the product I'm working on: A height-adjustable support for light workshop duties. I'm calling it the Screw Pad (working title).</p>
<p>The idea is to create something simple, that I can design and manufacture easily, so I can learn about all the other aspects of selling a physical product. Learning is the priority here. I don't expect to sell that many (or any üòÖ).</p>
<p>Despite choosing something simple, the design was a huge pain. Because of the screw thread. FreeCAD can do helical extrudes, of course, but it's buggy and I couldn't get it to work. SolveSpace can also do it, but support seems half-baked and weird. Commercial options don't run on Linux or are out of my price range.</p>
<p>I finally managed to do it with <a href="https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL" target="_blank">BOSL</a>. Despite my best efforts, I always keep coming back to OpenSCAD üòÑ</p>

</div>
<p>Did you know that I'm working on my own CAD application? It's called  <a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot" target="_blank">Fornjot</a> (at least for now).</p>
<p>Despite working on this (including several previous iterations) for several years now, it's still highly experimental and not fit for general use, as I explored multiple approaches that ended up not working out. It's a lot of fun though, and I feel I'm hitting my stride lately. Maybe something will come out of this yet!</p>

</div>
<p>I made a notebook! I started this project many months ago and procrastinated on it quite a bit. Hard to say why, in retrospect, because working on it was extremely satisfying. I guess it's just daunting to do something you never did before.</p>

        width="600" />
</div>
<p>It's a bit rough, due to my decidedly non-professional skills and equipment. But I like it! It serves me well enough, and I look forward to making another one, once this first one is full.</p>
