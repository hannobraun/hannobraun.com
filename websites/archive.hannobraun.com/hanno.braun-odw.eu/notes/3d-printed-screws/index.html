        <p>When I first learned that 3D printers can print screws, my reaction was one of mild surprise: Yes, why wouldn't you be able to print very rough screw threads with a 3D printer?</p>
<p>Some time later, my Prusa Mini arrived, and I discovered that the thumb drive it came with had models of a screw and a nut on it. I wanted to try that out.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/3d-printed-screws/big-screw.jpg"
        alt="A big 3D-printed screw, placed on a hand for size comparison."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>The result looked so perfect that I started wondering: This big screw could certainly not be the limit of what this printer is capable of. I wondered how much smaller I could go, while still getting functional screw threads.</p>
<p>So I started scaling down the <a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/13786-screw-and-nut" target="_blank">original model</a>. Here's the end result:</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/3d-printed-screws/screw-collection.jpg"
        alt="The big screw and nut from before in the background, with three smaller screw/nut combinations in front of it."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>I scaled the model down in PrusaSlicer, halving all dimensions each time. This resulted in 3 new screw/nut combinations: Half, quarter and one eighth the size of the original, respectively.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn't take notes or save the 3MF files, so the following is from memory:</p>
<ul>
<li>I printed the original with PrusaSlicer's default &quot;0.15mm QUALITY&quot; profile. The half-size screw/nut worked great with the same settings.</li>
<li>To get the quarter-size screw/nut to work, I had to adjust the layer height to 0.10 mm. This actually resulted in the nicest-feeling result. The fit between the original models is quite sloppy, and since I just scaled it down (without adjusting the thread tolerances), this just happened to result in the nicest fit at quarter size.</li>
<li>For the eight-size screw/nut, I adjusted the layer height to 0.05 mm. This one feels and works quite well too.</li>
</ul>
<p>I realize that none of this is going to be news for experienced printers, but I wasn't even remotely aware that it is possible to get this kind of detail out of a printer that costs 380‚Ç¨. I always knew that a 3D printer was going to be useful in the workshop, but this opens up many more possibilities.</p>
