    <h2>Notebook - Original Build</h2>
    <p>I have a notebook that I use almost daily. After watching a DiResta video or two about making notebooks, I was inspired to try my hand at creating one of my own. I had also wanted to try cork leather for a while, and this seemed like a great opportunity.</p>
<p>I'm currently using a Moleskine notebook (and have for years), with the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pocket-sized, a bit smaller than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216" target="_blank">A6</a>. That's large enough to be useful, and small enough to fit in my back pocket.</li>
<li>Soft cover, as having a hard cover in my back pocket doesn't feel that great.</li>
<li>Rounded corners, to further improve the back pocket feel.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is what I wanted to replicate with my own build. Here's the result.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img

        alt="A closed notebook, bound in cork leather."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>It's far from perfect, but I'm very happy with it. Especially for a first try.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/notebook-open.jpg"
        alt="An open notebook with blank pages. The sides of the paper are visibly rough."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>I had planned this project for a while, but kept procrastinating. Beyond the attributes laid out above, there were still so many decisions to make and things to consider. I finally decided that enough was enough, and that I was going to just keep it simple for the first go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just use printer paper. Probably not the best choice, but I already had it, and I figured it would do fine.</li>
<li>Blank pages. This did simplify things, as I got to use printer paper and didn't have to care about perfect orientation of every page.</li>
<li>No frills. My Moleskine notebooks have this flexible band, to keep the notebook closed, and a bookmark ribbon. Nice, but I can do without those.</li>
<li>I decided to go for 192 pages, as that's the same number as my usual notebooks have. Seemed like a good number.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would have preferred grid pattern paper, but figured I wouldn't be able to create something to replace my daily notebook anyway, on the first try. So I decided I would use the notebook mostly for sketches, for which the blank paper would work fine.</p>
<p>With those decisions made, I was finally ready to get started!</p>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>There were a few tools I needed. The only substantial one, which I decided to build myself, was a book press.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/book-press.jpg"
        alt="A book press, built from two cutting boards and some bolts and wing nuts from the hardware store."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>I adapted the concept from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeg8MH0PtI" target="_blank">this video by Sea Lemon on YouTube</a>. It didn't come out great, but it was cheap, and easy to do. The only real problem is, it's too big. I built this not only with the notebook in mind, but also with the idea that I might want to bind some ebooks I like, that aren't available to buy in paper form.</p>
<p>Figuring that since I can print A4 paper at home, I was going to need an A4-sized book press. Forgetting, of course, that I need to fold the paper to bind it as a book. So an A5-sized press would have been more than enough. Oh well.</p>
<p>Other than the book press, I only needed some small stuff, all of which I already has or ordered from <a href="https://www.modulor.de/en/" target="_blank">Modulor</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A knife</li>
<li>A ruler</li>
<li><a href="https://www.modulor.de/en/awl-l-125-mm-incl-point.html" target="_blank">An awl</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.modulor.de/en/bookbinding-needle-l-62-mm-o-1-2-mm.html" target="_blank">Bookbinding needles</a></li>
<li>Sandpaper</li>
<li><a href="https://www.modulor.de/en/corner-punch-for-roundeed-corners-radius-ca-10-mm.html" target="_blank">A corner punch for rounded corners</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<p>Like the tools, all of the materials required were pretty cheap and easily available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper: As explained above, I just decided to use printer paper.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.modulor.de/en/linen-binder-s-thread-th-0-42mm-type-30-3-150m-black.html" target="_blank">Binder&#x27;s thread</a></li>
<li>PVA glue</li>
<li><a href="https://cork-shop.com/Korkleder-Korkstoff-vegan-Leder-naehen-basteln-kreativ-viele-Designs-und-Abmessungen-Acacia-35x25cm_1" target="_blank">Cork leather</a> for the cover</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-build">The Build</h3>
<p>The first step was to create a text block. I'd never done this before, so I just followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGQ5P8QVHSg" target="_blank">another video by Sea Lemon</a> on YouTube.</p>
<h4 id="preparing-the-paper">Preparing the paper</h4>
<p>First problem: I have A4 paper, but need (roughly) A5-sized paper. Solution: Fold them, cut the folded end off.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/01-a4-folded.jpg"
        alt="A stack of folded A4 paper."
        width="600" />
</div>

</video>
<p>Repeating that a bunch of times gave me a nice stack of A5-ish paper.</p>


<div class="preview">

        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/03-a5-stack.jpg"
        alt="A stack of A5-ish sized paper."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>Next, I folded it and stacked it in groups of 4.</p>


<div class="preview">

        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/04-a5-folded.jpg"
        alt="A stack of folded A5-ish sized paper, stacked in groups of 4."
        width="600" />
</div>
<h4 id="making-and-preparing-the-signatures">Making and preparing the signatures</h4>
<p>Now I needed to needed to make the signatures. A signature is a group of 4 folded papers, nested within one another.</p>

</video>
<p>Yes, I work fast.</p>
<p>To create a text block, the signatures are sewn together. For that, I needed holes, so I marked the signatures where I wanted to make those.</p>

        alt="The stack of signatures, with markings to show where holes should be made."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>Making the holes with the awl was straight-forward.</p>

<p>At this point, I spotted this rare and wondrous sight: a wild shop dog.</p>


<div class="preview">

        alt="A dog lying under the workshop table, between my feet."
        width="600" />
</div>
<h4 id="sewing-and-glueing-the-text-block">Sewing and glueing the text block</h4>
<p>Next, I sewed the signatures together to make the text block.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/08-text-block.jpg"
        alt="The signatures, sewn together into a text block."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>Unfortunately I don't have any video from here on, but I did it exactly as shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGQ5P8QVHSg" target="_blank">the video I followed</a>.</p>
<p>I glued the text block using two coats of PVA glue.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/09-text-block-glued.jpg"
        alt="The text block, pressed together in the book pressed, with PVA glue applied along its spine."
        width="600" />
</div>
<h4 id="cover-and-finishing">Cover and finishing</h4>
<p>This is where I went a bit off the rails. The Sea Lemon video shows adding an end page to each side, and a piece of paper to the spine. At least the piece of paper on the spine would have been a good idea for me too, as the signatures ended up moving. But more on that below.</p>
<p>I just glued a piece of cork leather directly on the text block.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/10-cover-glue-up.jpg"
        alt="The text block, a piece of cork leather glued around it as the cover, in the book press."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>The glue-up resulted in the signatures moving, and a large gap forming between the spine and the cover.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/11-notebook-spine-gap.jpg"
        alt="A close-up of the notebook, shown from the side. The signatures have moved relative to each other. The spine of the text block is no longer straight, an there&#x27;s a large gap between the spine and the cover in that location."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>This is the aspect of the build I'm least happy with. Next time, I'll definitely add a paper to stabilize the spine. Possibly, I'll also glue the cover in two stages, one side at a time. Having one half of the cover fixed might help with getting a tighter fit while positioning the other half.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/12-notebook-unfinished.jpg"
        alt="The notebook, glued up but not yet finished. The edges of the cover and paper are not aligned with each other."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>To finish the notebook, all that was left to do at this point was to cut off some of the cover and paper along the edges, to get a smooth face. I used a combination square to cut a straight line, at a right angle to the spine.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/13-notebook-edge-cutting.jpg"
        alt="The notebook, a combination square held to it to allow for cutting in a straight, at a right angle to the spine."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, whatever skill you have to acquire, or talent you have to be born with, to hold a knife upright while cutting along the straight line, I don't have it. This led to a result that was less than straight.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a bit of sand paper did the trick.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/14-notebook-sanding.jpg"
        alt="The notebook, held in the book press. The visible face having been sanded to be a bit straighter than it was directly after the cut."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>I started with a fine grid (120, I believe), but that didn't work very well. A coarser sandpaper (60, if memory serves) worked great.</p>
<p>The result still looked a bit ragged. Maybe this could be improved using another go with finer sandpaper, but I honestly like the rougher look. It's handmade, after all.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/original-build/15-notebook-one-face-finished.jpg"
        alt="The notebook up close, with one face sanded to be reasonably straight. The look is still somewhat ragged."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>I repeated the cutting and sanding with the other sides, using the combination square to make sure all sides were roughly straight and square.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As I said in the beginning, I'm very happy with the result, especially for a first try. Although there are things I'd do differently, as explained above.</p>
<p>I already started using it, to sketch some ideas. Using a notebook I made myself is a nice feeling! At this point, I have no firm plans, but I'm pretty sure I'll make another one at some point.</p>
