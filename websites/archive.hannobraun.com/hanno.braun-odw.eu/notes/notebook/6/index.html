    <h2>Notebook #6</h2>
    

<div class="preview">

        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/6/finished-closed.jpg"
        alt="A closed notebook, bound in cork leather."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>Notebook #6, and my last one for the time being! I managed to finally integrate the rubber band to keep it closed, which is pretty neat.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/6/finished-closeup.jpg"
        alt="A closeup of bottom side of the notebook, the bookmark sticking out. The edges of the paper and cover are visibly rough."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>This one was a lot of work! The spine kind of got away from me and deformed in the book press. That meant all the other sides were very uneven too, and had to be sanded away.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/6/finished-open.jpg"
        alt="The same notebook, open. The bookmark between the open pages."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>A real pain, but in the end, I came away somewhat happy. <em>Almost</em> in the mood to make yet another one.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/6/finished-signature.jpg"
        alt="The notebook, showing the following signature on the inside of the cover: Notebook · Hanno Braun · 2022-W34 · #6 · Made in Odenwald"
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>But no. This is the last one for the time being. Maybe I'll try again some time, but for now, I have enough of sanding paper.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here are some pictures I took during the build.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/6/build-01-text-block.jpg"
        alt="The un-glued text block."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>The text block, before the glue-up. The spine hadn't yet gotten out of control.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/6/build-02-text-block-partly-finished.jpg"
        alt="The text block, partially finished. The front side is unfinished, and really uneven."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>Here's a picture of the problem I was facing. Lots of unevenness, lots of sanding necessary.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/6/build-03-text-block-mostly-finished.jpg"
        alt="The text block, finished except for the unrounded corners."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>I eventually managed to even it out.</p>


<div class="preview">
    <img
        src="/hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/6/build-04-rubber-band.jpg"
        alt="The rubber band, glued to the inside of the cover, which isn&#x27;t fully attached to the text block yet."
        width="600" />
</div>
<p>The new feature of notebook #6: The rubber band, to keep it closed.</p>
