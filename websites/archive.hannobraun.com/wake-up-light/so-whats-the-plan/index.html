                    <p>Last week, I wrote about <a href="/wake-up-light/i-enjoyed-making-notebooks/" rel="noreferrer">my motivations for getting (back) into physical products</a>.
 Soon, I'll tell you about the next product I'm working on. But for now,
 let's stay with motivations for a bit. Because I have some that I 
haven't talked about so far. Ulterior motives, so to speak?</p><p>In 
this post, I'm going into the reasons I started this website, the 
strategy I have for it, and how that strategy relates to the physical 
products I'm going to create. This look behind the scenes is available 
to paid members only.</p><!--members-only--><h2 id="the-big-picture">The big picture</h2><p>Let's do a quick overview on how I'm thinking about this website:</p><ul><li>The intended audience are people who are interested in designing, making, and selling physical products, just like me.</li><li>The goal is <em>not</em> to market my products here, although that could be a welcome side effect.</li><li>I
 have no idea if paid memberships are going to be successful, but maybe 
they can help offset some of the hosting and prototyping costs.</li><li>While
 I figure out how to earn a living from physical products, I'd like to 
sell services to my target audience. Software development (which is my 
strongest skill), and maybe coaching and consulting to complement that.</li><li>I
 also hope to connect with other physical product enthusiasts, online 
and in person. For the sense of community, and to explore opportunities 
for collaboration.</li></ul><p>That's the gist of it!</p><h2 id="choosing-an-audience">Choosing an audience</h2><p>I think choosing an audience is important. In writing, but also in business. Knowing <em>who it's for</em> just makes <em>everything</em>
 so much easier. I've long been interested in creating physical 
products, and I've long thought about what a suitable audience for them 
could be.</p><p>I need to like that audience, care about the things they
 care about; or it will be hard to stay with them long-term. I need to 
be able to reach them, so I can learn about them and their problems. And
 I need to be able to actually help solve those problems, or there won't
 be a product.</p><p>This is very important, but it's also difficult. 
There is a lot of room here for procrastination, for self-doubt. Which 
audience should I serve? Can I stay interested for long? Can I even help
 them? I have so little experience with physical products. It would take
 so long to get anywhere!</p><p>And so, while I've dabbled, I never really got started. Until I had an insight.</p><p>Yes,
 I have little experience with physical products. Yes, it will take very
 long to get anywhere. Yes, it might be unlikely that I can stay with 
the same audience, product after product. But there has been one 
constant for me all this time: my interest in physical products itself.</p><p>So
 that's where I'll start. I'll use my journey of learning and 
exploration as a catalyst for serving an audience of people that care 
about the same thing I do. I'll help those people solve problems using 
skills I already have (software!), and I'll build more relevant skills 
to use as I get farther along.</p><p>And the physical products? Those 
now exist as a means of learning, and to provide content for my primary 
audience. That takes a lot of pressure out of it. I can just choose to 
follow whatever path seems most suitable to take me to the next 
milestone. No more big questions to hold me back!</p><h2 id="balancing-short-term-and-long-term-goals">Balancing short-term and long-term goals</h2><p>Developing
 physical products costs money. Living life costs money! And I don't 
expect to be financially successful selling physical products any time 
soon. And while I certainly hope to live very comfortably doing that at 
some point, I need something else until then.</p><p>I already mentioned 
that I want to sell software development, or related services like 
consulting and coaching, to other people creating physical products. If 
this works, I expect it to mesh very well with my long-term goals, on 
top off making me money in the short term.</p><p>It will help me meet 
like-minded people. I will get to work on their products, gaining 
insights I might not have learned on my own. I will gain experience from
 that, which will help me with my own products. And the experience from 
my own products will teach me more valuable skills, to help my audience 
with, in turn.</p><h2 id="on-partnerships">On partnerships</h2><p>I know
 it's possible to design, make, and sell physical products fully on your
 own. People have done it. Are doing it. I'm trying to do that for my 
initial products. That doesn't mean it will always be my preferred 
choice.</p><p>Partnering up with others, pooling your skills and 
resources, can make things easier. Or a product more successful. Or it 
could allow me to go for something that I couldn't achieve on my own.</p><p>I
 don't know what this would look like, specifically. Maybe I could 
partner with people that have similar skills, doubling down to create 
something that is very strong in one area. Maybe I could be part of a 
team with complementary skills, giving us better coverage over the whole
 process.</p><p>Maybe I could take care of (most of) the development, 
but then partner with someone who has access to the product's target 
market.</p><p>There are lots of possibilities, and the details don't 
matter at this point. But opportunities can arise from joining a 
community of like-minded people.</p><h2 id="thats-it">That's it!</h2><p>I
 hope I've managed to convey the thinking that has led me down this 
path. And I hope that maybe I've given you some thoughts that can be 
valuable to your own work!</p><p>But be that as it may, please <a href="mailto:hello@hannobraun.com" rel="noreferrer">let me know what you think</a>!
 A lot of what I'll do will be public, but I want to keep writing these 
posts for my paid members, to provide more detail, and more of my 
thoughts. Your feedback can help shape what that's going to look like.</p>
