                    <p>
                        For the last few day's, I've been talking about the
                        platform concept that I'm stealing from Roc. I initially
                        thought about platforms in terms of, CLI, desktop,
                        servers, browsers; places where you can run your
                        applications, that might look very different from each
                        other. But I discovered that the platform concept is
                        widely applicable, and can be used in more subtle ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier on, I talked about compile-time execution of
                        Caterpillar code. This is a very different environment,
                        with different considerations. And it's not an easy
                        thing to do, if your language wasn't designed for it!
                        Using Rust as an example again, at some point it gained
                        <code>const fn</code>. But that didn't just solve the
                        problem. What you can or can't do in a <code
                        >const</code> context has been a perpetual topic ever
                        since, with every new release unlocking at least a few
                        more standard library functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what if your language can do nothing by default, and
                        gets all its capabilities from an external platform?
                        Then suddenly it's very easy. Because the compiler is
                        just another platform, which can provide you with I/O
                        primitives that are suitable for its context. Everything
                        that can be powered by those I/O primitives <em>just
                            works</em>. And everything else can still be made to
                        work, as long as you manage to mock the required
                        primitives.
