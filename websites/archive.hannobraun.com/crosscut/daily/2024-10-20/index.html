                        I try my absolute best to never solve a general problem.
                        This has been a painful lesson I had to learn over and
                        over. Not only is a general problem much harder to solve
                        than a specific one, it's also much easier to get the
                        solution wrong. Because I can never fully grasp the full
                        scope of what I'm trying to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So how do I manage to work on a programming language? I
                        do my best to be very clear on what I want to do <em
                        >right now</em>, and then I solve a specific problem
                        that arises from that. Once that's done, I make sure
                        that I still know what I want, then I solve the next
                        problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At some point, one of those problems leads me back to an
                        earlier solution, that is now a bit <em>too
                            specific</em>. So I expand it to solve my new
                        problem, while trying not to un-solve the previous one.
                        Doing this, I slowly approach a more general solution
                        incrementally. And I like that much more. Because at
                        every step, it's very clear whether I'm done, or if
                        there's more work to do.
