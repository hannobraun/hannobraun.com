                        There is this seemingly widespread belief, that <em
                        >if</em> you're going to need breaking changes, you
                        better put them all into a single release. One big 2.0
                        version, with long periods stability before and after.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I never understood that. Seriously, I'm completely
                        baffled by this concept. Upgrading to such a release is
                        a big task. And there's probably no practical way to do
                        it incrementally. It's one huge, all-or-nothing change;
                        probably all over your code base. That's the opposite of
                        how I write software, for so many reasons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, why wouldn't we do your best to trickle those
                        changes out slowly, in small pieces. Maybe start with a
                        deprecation. Give users time to upgrade to the new
                        thing. Make every release "breaking", in a way, but
                        never break anything that hasn't been deprecated for a
                        while.
