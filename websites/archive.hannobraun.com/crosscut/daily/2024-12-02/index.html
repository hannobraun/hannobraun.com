                        There's quite a bit of <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-12-01"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >overhead</a> to making rewinding work. I think that's
                        unavoidable, since immediacy is the central theme of
                        Caterpillar, and <em>"I ran into an error; have to set a
                            breakpoint earlier, then restart and do the same
                            things that led to the error, for a second
                            time"</em> is not very immediate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But we shouldn't need to pay for the full overhead in
                        every single situation. As I've noticed before, the
                        overhead <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-11-21"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >can be reduced</a>
                        significantly, by undoing groups of expressions as a
                        unit, instead of supporting that for every single
                        expression, one by one. But I think it's fine to have
                        the full overhead during development, for the code
                        you're currently editing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other code maybe doesn't need to be undo-able in as
                        fine-grained a manner, although how to decide that
                        specifically is still an open question. Maybe for
                        third-party code, it's good enough (by default) to only
                        undo a whole function call into that third-party code as
                        a unit. And it should be possible to turn the feature
                        off completely, in cases where you need all the
                        available performance.
