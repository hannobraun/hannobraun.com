                        That's it, I guess! I've said all I have to say about
                        the type system. (Except, I already have notes for a
                        series to recap and clarify one specific aspect of it;
                        but that's not a topic for today.) Next, I think it's
                        time for an update on development! After all, I've been
                        working on the new prototype for
                        <a

                        To be blunt, the whole thing has been a bit of a pain,
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-17"

                        >exactly as predicted</a>. Having a code database has
                        wide-reaching consequences. The compiler is looking
                        completely different than any previous iteration. The
                        custom <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_editor"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >structure editor</a> I'm building has been a source of
                        much work; and it's very clear, it will take a long time
                        to get right.

                    <p>
                        These factors are turning every little problem that I
                        face into a micro-R&amp;D project. There's just so much
                        to figure out. And that has made progress on the actual
                        language very, very slow. But so far, I still believe
                        it's worth it. I knew what I was getting into, after
                        all.
