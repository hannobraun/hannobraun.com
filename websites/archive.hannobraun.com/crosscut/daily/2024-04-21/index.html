                        Event Sourcing is a software architecture in which every
                        change to application state is encoded as a value, an
                        event. These events are executed deterministically, so
                        you can use them to reconstruct any past state. And if
                        you add the required information to these events, you
                        can also undo them, rewinding to an earlier state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the last few days, I've been talking about how to
                        step backwards through a Caterpillar program. If Event
                        Sourcing is to play a role in supporting this, then the
                        language runtime and debugger need to understand events.
                        Where they are stored, how to apply them to application
                        state, how to undo them. All of this implies a pretty
                        close relationship between the Caterpillar runtime and
                        an application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The runtime would act more like a framework than a
                        typical language runtime, which certainly wouldn't be a
                        good fit for all use cases. But thanks to the platform
                        concept, it could be optional. Maybe I can come up with
                        an approach that allows applications to easily opt into
                        event sourcing functionality when they want to improve
                        their interactivity, without weighing down applications
                        that don't need it.
