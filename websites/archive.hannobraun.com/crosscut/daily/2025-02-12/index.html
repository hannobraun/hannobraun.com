                        Okay, so we're using postfix syntax, functions have one
                        input and one output, and composite values <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-02-10"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"

                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-05-03"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >why I like postfix syntax</a>, but I want to highlight
                        one aspect in particular, that I didn't fully appreciate
                        until my latest detour into the prefix world.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's a piece of code in postfix syntax:</p>
                    <pre><code>first_do_this then_this finally_this</code></pre>
                    <p>Here's the same piece of code, in prefix syntax:</p>
                    <pre><code>finally_this(then_this(first_do_this()))</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        I realize that prefix syntax is more familiar to most
                        people, which translates into being more intuitive.
                        (Which many people, erroneously, then view as a fixed
                        quality; not as just a consequence of familiarity.) But
                        I dare you to tell me that the example above is easier
                        to understand in prefix syntax, where you have to read
                        it inside-out, instead of in the order you'd write it
                        in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This difference is more pronounced, if you work in an
                        interactive environment, that executes your code as you
                        type it. The postfix example above, you can type start
                        to finish, and you'll see intermediate results as they
                        become available. The prefix example, you either type
                        inside out, which results in more editing. Or you type
                        it left-to-right, and then only get a result when you're
                        finished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe this won't make that much of a difference under
                        realistic circumstances. I don't know, because I haven't
                        gotten so far that I could experience that. But working
                        with <a
                            href="https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/tree/main/archive/prototypes/12"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >prototype 12</a>, my brief detour into prefix syntax,
                        this effect was really obvious. And working with the new
                        prototype now, the increase in immediacy is striking.
