                        A few months back, when I started working on the current
                        iteration of Caterpillar, big things got done all the
                        time. And that kept going for a bit, until recently. And
                        now I'm getting lost in details. Bugs in the game,
                        leading to bugs in the debugger, leading to rethinking
                        tail call elimination, leading to revamping how the call
                        stack works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Part of it is, I've not been as laser-focused recently
                        as I was before. But it's also natural. Early on, you
                        make big steps. Day 1 you create something from nothing.
                        Day 2 you still double what's there. Day 3 you only grow
                        what you have by 50%. And this doesn't even consider
                        that you don't just write new code. What you already
                        have gets in the way, and regularly needs to be updated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This ties in with the
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-07-27"

                        that took me by surprise recently. So much of what I'm
                        doing these days, is making the existing infrastructure
                        more solid. And a lot of good is coming out ot it. I'm
                        laying foundations, and it's going to make future work
                        easier. I guess I just didn't expect to be doing so much
                        of that yet.
