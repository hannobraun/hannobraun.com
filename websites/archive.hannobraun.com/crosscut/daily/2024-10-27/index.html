                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        So maybe, based on <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-10-26"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >my arguments from yesterday</a>, it makes sense to stay
                        with game development for the time being. To have a
                        stable platform for more improvements to the language
                        and tooling, and to have an easy way to show off those
                        improvements to anybody who cares to see them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And maybe, even if a focus on microcontroller firmware
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-10-24"

                        >might make more sense overall</a>, it doesn't really
                        matter right now. With the current state of the project,
                        I won't impress anyone either way. So why not stay the
                        course, make things work very well, and when the time
                        comes, switch over and start out strong on the other
                        side?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That approach would come with some more subjective
                        advantages too: I've genuinely been looking forward to
                        using Caterpillar to create small games, to participate
                        in game jams, to try out some techniques in the game
                        engine, and to learn more about GPUs. And it would be
                        nice to have another creative outlet. If that benefits
                        the development of Caterpillar, all the better.
