                        >focused on game development</a> as an initial use case
                        for Crosscut. And so I'm building a minimalist game
                        engine that uses Crosscut as the programming language.
                        Since a <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-15"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >custom editor</a>
                        is part of that, this game engine comes in the form of a
                        self-contained application, as opposed to just a
                        library.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the first priority is not to make a great game
                        engine. It's to create a
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-20"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >tight, interactive core</a> that provides an immediate
                        connection between you and your live program. This means
                        that the interactive editor with integrated debugging
                        functionality, including less common features like
                        stepping back through your code, are most important
                        right now.

                    <p>
                        Anything that doesn't directly support this interactive
                        core, must wait. That means I'll keep the language
                        minimal, for the time being. It means platform support
                        of the game engine is limited. And once I get to the
                        point where I want to publish a game again, I'll
                        implement that as an export to a static web page,
                        without interactive connection to the engine. The scope
                        needs to stay small.
