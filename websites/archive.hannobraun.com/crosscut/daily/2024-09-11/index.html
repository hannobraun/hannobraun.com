                        layout. If you define a struct, a compiler might
                        re-order its fields for better performance. I don't have
                        room to go into the reasons for that here, but if you're
                        interested, <a

                        This reordering, while beneficial, is also problematic.
                        It means that you can't rely on a struct's layout, which
                        is relevant for storage, communication, even function
                        calls. But again, what if layout optimization happens in
                        pre-compilation, and the already optimized struct gets
                        stored in the database (where it is <a

                        The developer would see right in the code what the
                        compiler did. And in any situations where we exchange
                        the struct with another entity that might have a
                        different version of it, whatever tooling is involved
                        can recognize the incompatibility, maybe even fix it, as
                        long as type information is available.
