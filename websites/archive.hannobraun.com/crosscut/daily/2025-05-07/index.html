                        Okay then, time to go into my reasons for switching away
                        from postfix syntax as the <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-05-06"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >current default</a>. I plan to go over each one in
                        detail later. But for now, here's an overview:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The root of the syntax tree is not stationary in the
                            upper-left corner, as it would be with prefix
                            syntax. It moves around as you edit, up and down,
                            left and right. This is weird to look at, and makes
                            some edits outright confusing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Postfix syntax makes it natural to type the children
                            of a node first, before the node itself. But <a
                                href="/crosscut/daily/2025-05-04"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                            >restricted structural editing</a>
                            requires you to enter the <em>parent</em> first,
                            before the children get created. This leads to
                            awkwardness.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Postfix syntax puts code into the order it's
                            executed in, without the developer having to force
                            that using bindings. But to make that actually work,
                            you need some kind of combinators. Those don't
                            exist, the design is unclear, and none of that will
                            be a priority any time soon.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <a
                                href="/crosscut/daily/2025-04-27"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                            >"series of statements"</a> style that algebraic
                            effects enable also has the consequence of putting
                            more code into the order in which it's executed,
                            further eroding this advantage of postfix syntax.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        None of those reasons is a single big one that forced
                        this change. But together, I believe, they form a
                        compelling argument. And with <a
                            href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >innovation tokens</a> being a recurring theme in my
                        thinking recently, a critical mass was reached. Because
                        not only does this change fix those problems, it also
                        puts this part of the language into well-explored
                        territory.
