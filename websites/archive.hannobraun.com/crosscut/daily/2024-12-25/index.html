                        Let's move on from algebraic effects for now. There's
                        more to say about it (I still have lots of notes). And
                        in fact, I just had a new idea that might change things
                        in this area completely. But let's leave that for later.
                        Instead, I want to talk about a topic that I avoided
                        dealing with for a while now. Probably because it's
                        scary and not urgent, which is never a good combination

                        <strong>Caterpillar needs a new name!</strong> I like
                        the current one, and it was great while this was just a
                        little side project. But as I was getting more serious
                        about it, I've started thinking about <a
                            href="https://www.caterpillar.com/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >existing brands</a>, domain availability, and other
                        concerns. This was a protracted process that is now
                        over, so I won't go into it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, let's just get to the point: <strong>The new
                            name is Crosscut.</strong> It's an English word
                        that's easy to say, write, and remember for many people
                        worldwide. As best I can tell, there are no trademarks
                        that could get me into trouble. And I already found a
                        domain that I like. It also means "shortcut" (among
                        other things), which fits, since its kinda what I'm
                        going for with this language.
