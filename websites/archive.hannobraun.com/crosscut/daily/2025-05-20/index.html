                        That's it. I went through the whole <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-05-07"

                        >list of reasons</a> for switching to prefix syntax. And
                        at the very least, I thoroughly convinced myself that it
                        was the right decision. I think that with the benefit of
                        hindsight, it's pretty clear that postfix syntax died
                        the moment I switched away from a stack-based evaluation
                        model. Those two only make sense together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And, as if to demonstrate how overdue this change was,
                        switching to prefix syntax was quite easy. Most of the
                        work took place in the test suite. Anything else barely
                        required any modifications. The evaluation model was
                        already tailor-made for prefix syntax.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm still convinced that there is room for <em>some</em>
                        postfix syntax in the language, eventually. Look at
                        <code>.method()</code> syntax and pipe operators in many
                        languages. Look at the <code>?</code> operator in Rust,
                        and <code>.await</code>. It simply makes sense,
                        sometimes. But not as the default. Not in a language
                        that isn't stack-based.
