                    <p>
                        Yesterday, I <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-12-20"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >presented an example</a> that combines linear types and
                        multiple effects. Here it is again:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
<code>file
    "a" write
    "b" write</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        <code>write</code> is going to trigger some kind of
                        effect that signals the host that it needs to write to a
                        file (let's call that <code>Write</code>). In principle,
                        the host could decide not to resume this code after
                        handling the effect, and if that happens, our linear
                        value here (<code>file</code>) would have nowhere to go.
                        But it's <em>linear</em>, so it <em>needs</em> to go
                        somewhere. We can't just drop it implicitly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think this can be solved by expressing in the type
                        system, that the code
                        <em>must</em> resume after the <code>Write</code>
                        effect. The host could still not do it, but the host
                        could mess up in any number of ways that language design
                        can't prevent. Any Caterpillar code handling that effect
                        could be forced to always resume, by the compiler. The
                        drawback is the additional complexity this introduces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow, I'd like to look at the second effect that
                        <code>write</code> could trigger, in the case of an
                        error.
