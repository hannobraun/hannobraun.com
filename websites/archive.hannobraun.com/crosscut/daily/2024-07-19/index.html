                        I talked a bit about linear types on here, but there's
                        one important aspect I completely forgot to mention:
                        Linear types can track ownership, and thus can be used
                        to implement automatic memory management at
                        compile-time, like in Rust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That is very important to me. I think there are so many
                        reasons to not want a garbage collector. It's a big
                        black box that's running in your process, doing its own
                        thing. Granted, for a purely functional language, there
                        are better approaches. <a

                        >Roc</a> can get away with just reference counting,
                        since immutability means that reference cycles can not
                        be constructed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I'm thinking, if Caterpillar is going to get linear
                        types anyway, for all the reasons I mentioned, why not
                        go that extra step and get automatic memory management
                        with no runtime overhead? I think Rust has shown us
                        what's possible. Now it's on the next generation of
                        languages to show that, hopefully, we can do the same,
                        but without much of the complexity.
