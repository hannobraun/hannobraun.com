                    <p>
                        Yesterday, I talked about how Caterpillar can be a
                        simpler form of Rust. I also said that it can be a more
                        powerful one, but then glossed over that completely.
                        Here's one of the ways in which I'd like to make
                        Caterpillar more powerful than Rust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that most programming languages are really two
                        languages in one. One to describe the runtime behavior,
                        like defining variables and calling functions. Another
                        for the compile-time behavior; defining functions, the
                        type system. What if we used the same language for both
                        parts? Then a macro would just be a function. The type
                        system would just be a library. Can this work? I don't
                        know. (Then again, I'm probably not the first to come up
                        with this idea. I wouldn't be surprised if Lisp worked
                        exactly like this.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe it would be a total mess. But what if it works?
                        Would it mean that we can have an advanced type system
                        that every competent Caterpillar developer can just
                        innately understand, because they can always jump to the
                        code that does whatever currently confuses them? Could
                        we use Caterpillar's interactivity tooling to debug
                        what's happening at compile time? I don't know, but it
                        sounds like a promising possibility!
