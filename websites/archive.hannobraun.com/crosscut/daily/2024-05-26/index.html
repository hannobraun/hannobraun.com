                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        Having a working product that you can incrementally
                        improve, can be a great asset in guiding further
                        development. Especially, if it has real users, which
                        provide feedback to you. (And that feedback might be
                        that you don't like how they're using it, and you need
                        to change direction.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I noted recently, this incremental approach might
                        require taking a circuitous path towards your vision.
                        You might need to implement things that won't make it to
                        the final version (if there is such a thing), that take
                        the project into a different direction for the time
                        being.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think all of this is worthwhile. It would be way worse
                        to toil in secret for a long time, building something
                        that you imagine will be good, but that nobody ever
                        wants. Or build towards a big vision that you would
                        otherwise have known is the wrong one. Or lose
                        motivation because all you have is a lot of work and no
                        pay-off.
