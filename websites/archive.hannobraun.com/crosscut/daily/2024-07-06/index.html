                        So, how do you track I/O in a functional language? <a
                            href="https://www.haskell.org/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >Haskell</a> does it by encoding I/O operations into a
                        monad. (If you don't know what a monad is, then for the
                        purpose of this discussion, just think it as a container
                        for data that describes a series of I/O operations.)
                        That monad is returned to the runtime, which executes
                        the operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think I understand why Haskell does it like that, but
                        it's not how I want to do it in Caterpillar. Instead, I
                        want to represent anything that can do I/O (like a file,
                        for example) as values. A function that writes to a file
                        needs to take the value representing that file as an
                        argument, and return an updated version, which
                        represents the file after it's been written to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That way, the developer, the compiler, or the runtime,
                        can clearly see the file value going through that
                        function. I think this requires linear (or affine) types
                        though, and that's probably the reason Haskell uses the
                        (seemingly) more complicated monad-based technique. (I
                        don't have enough room left to explain linear types
                        today, but I'm sure I'll get to them sooner or later.)
