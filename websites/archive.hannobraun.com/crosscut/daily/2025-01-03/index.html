                        syntax, compared to traditional plain text source code.
                        A code database with a custom editor could though,
                        depending on how it works. Let's dive into that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of two main things that the editor does, is render
                        the structured code, in a way that makes sense to the
                        developer. It would take the raw data from the database,
                        which wouldn't include any information on how to format
                        the code (although it could, but I don't want that), and
                        format that in a way that looks like you'd expect a
                        programming language to look like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other main thing would be input. You'd have a cursor
                        that you move using the arrow keys (and others), as in a
                        normal editor. Like modern IDEs, it could let you
                        navigate in terms of code concepts (functions, modules,
                        etc.), but here, this would be the natural way to do it.
                        The interesting thing, in my mind, would happen if you
                        start typing new code. Let's talk about that tomorrow.
