                    <p>
                        I've talked about the possibility of exporting a program
                        from the interactive runtime, into a fully compiled and
                        optimized form for production deployment. But what if we
                        had a more advanced, more flexible form of that concept?
                        What if we could decide on the fly which parts of the
                        program are "solid", i.e. compiled and optimized, or
                        "fluid", i.e. with full support for interactive
                        programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At any point, we could decide to change the boundary
                        between solid and fluid, whether the program is running
                        in a local development environment or a remote
                        staging/production environment. That might take a few
                        seconds, compiling/optimizing/linking the solid code and
                        deploying the new version, but so what? Afterwards, we
                        could manipulate the fluid parts of the program in a
                        fully interactive way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is just an idea. Maybe it wouldn't be as useful as
                        I imagine it. But if it worked out, it would turn
                        interactive programming in Caterpillar into a
                        zero-overhead abstraction. It would no longer slow down
                        code that doesn't use it.
