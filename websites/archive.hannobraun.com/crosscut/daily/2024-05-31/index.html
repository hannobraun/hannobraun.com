                        Semantic versioning is a widespread practice, to manage
                        breaking changes and communicate which releases contain
                        them. Version 2.0 contains breaking changes. Version 2.1
                        doesn't, nor does any other 2.x release. You don't have
                        to worry again until 3.0.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my experience, this can work pretty well. But for a
                        large project, it seems to be limiting. There could be
                        new features, that are experimental and still subject to
                        change. Older ones, that are stable and mature. Even
                        older ones that you want to change again, because you
                        now understand all their flaws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that trying to address this all with a single
                        semantic version number might be too coarse-grained.
                        Rust, for example, seems to acknowledge this, by using
                        using additional mechanisms (a nightly channel with
                        unstable features, and the limited but effective edition
                        mechanism). I wonder, if there's a simpler way for
                        Caterpillar.
