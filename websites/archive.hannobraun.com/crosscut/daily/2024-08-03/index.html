                        >the advantages of a content-addressed code
                            database</a>. There are a few more, but for various
                        reasons, I'll just quickly gloss over them.

                    <p>
                        A content-addressed code database enables better
                        tooling. Tools like formatters or linters don't need to
                        bring their own parsers. They can rely on the full power
                        of the compiler, as the pre-compiled intermediate
                        representation is available in the code database. I'm
                        sure I'll have more to say about tooling in the future,
                        so I won't speak on it any further here.

                        >Unison</a> offers built-in support for distributed
                        programming and typed durable storage. Both are
                        super-interesting, but they don't fit Caterpillar's
                        current focus. Maybe one day! Finally,
                        content-addressing is very useful to implement
                        interactive programming, which is very relevant for
                        Caterpillar. I'll surely go into that more deeply, as I
                        re-implement it in the current version.
