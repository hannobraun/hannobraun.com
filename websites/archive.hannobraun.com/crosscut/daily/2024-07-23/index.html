                        Besides types and effects, there's more about
                        Caterpillar code that the tooling could infer. Let's
                        look at Rust for a moment: It has a distinction between
                        supposedly cheap (and hence implicit) copies, and
                        potentially expensive (and hence explicit) clones. (This
                        <a
                            href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2024/06/21/claim-auto-and-otherwise/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >doesn't work perfectly and might get changed</a>, but
                        we can ignore that here.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This distinction makes sense, and we might or might not
                        end up having something like that in Caterpillar. If we
                        end up not having it, we could get the same effect (or
                        maybe even do better) by inferring and displaying
                        information about performance characteristics of your
                        code.

                        Imagine looking at a function, and having each
                        expression color-coded, based on their relative cost.
                        This could be based on heuristics, or actual
                        measurements. Either way, it's another example of the
                        principle I've been talking about: Designing the
                        language with tooling in mind allows us to make certain
                        things explicit, without requiring the developer to
                        actually write them out.
