                        Spreadsheet software is great! (I'm using LibreOffice
                        Calc quite regularly.) The way it combines data model
                        and user interface is awesome. It allows you to get
                        started with some quick-and-dirty calculations quite
                        easily, and gives you as much insight as you need, into
                        what is happening.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But for any spreadsheet that grows beyond trivial, it
                        also sucks. Those cell IDs don't compare to good
                        variable names. Copy-pasting cells is a poor excuse for
                        code reuse. For these reasons, refactoring gets quite
                        messy. And when I need to do some real programming, I
                        need to dust off this weird BASIC that I can never
                        remember how to use. (Or I'm doing it wrong. Also quite
                        possible!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe an interactive programming language with good
                        tooling can fill a similar niche, but in a cleaner and
                        more powerful way. You write code from the start. You
                        have insight, because you see what every single
                        expression is doing. If you combine that with a really
                        simple UI library (like, not much more complicated than
                        the cells of a spreadsheet), maybe that could really go
                        somewhere.
