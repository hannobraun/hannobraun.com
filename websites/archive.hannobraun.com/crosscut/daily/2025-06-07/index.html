                        games has a lot of advantages. The project would get
                        room to breathe. I wouldn't need to hurry, to make
                        Crosscut a viable language on its own. It could mature
                        slowly, which I'm sure would improve the outcome.

                        I think there's a risk though, of splitting my focus. To
                        some degree, that can't be avoided. Crosscut <a

                        convinced of that. But starting to work on them right
                        now, and writing more of their code in Rust, that's a
                        bigger detour than doing pure Crosscut games at some
                        undefined point in the future.

                        It's a trade-off. And I think on balance, the advantages
                        outweigh the disadvantages. Maybe. Or maybe I'm letting
                        my <a

                        laser-focused could be the superior play. As usual,
                        there's only one way to find out, and that's to make the
                        choice and run with it.
