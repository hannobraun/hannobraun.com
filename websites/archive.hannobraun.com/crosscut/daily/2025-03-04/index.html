                        I'm not writing these daily notes because I expect
                        people to read them. Maybe that will change at some
                        point. Once Crosscut has found a user base, I'll
                        probably end up posting more things here that are
                        intended to help those users, and less about ideas for
                        its future development. But we'll see how that turns
                        out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the meantime (and I've said this before), I have a
                        different reason for writing daily: It helps me think.
                        And the recent
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-03-01"

                        >detour into modules</a> has been a great example of
                        that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I started, I only had vague ideas about how modules
                        could work. Now that I've written down the core of this
                        fuzzy concept, I've already identified parts of it that
                        won't work, developed ideas on how to address that, and
                        wrote all of that down. Over time I'll expand those
                        notes, until they turn into a series of notes I post
                        here. Which will then provide even more clarity.
