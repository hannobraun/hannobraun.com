                        There are a quite a few specific reasons why I've
                        started working on a new prototype and want to <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-09"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >retire the previous one</a>. Here's the list:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Planning for having a code database, but not having
                            one, is a bad situation. Every design decision I
                            make is either preliminary or suboptimal. And the
                            longer this is going on, the greater the impact,
                            should the whole idea just not work out.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Interactive programming has limitations and missing
                            features, that effectively render it useless. And
                            that's hard to fix, because of some of the other
                            problems on this list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The debugger is broken all the time. And still,
                            keeping it updated is a constant drag on resources.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The current approach to syntax is too ambitious for
                            now. I'm not aware of any language that does it
                            quite like I've been trying to, which constantly
                            leads to open questions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The stack-based evaluation model also is too
                            ambitious for now. It was easy to get started with,
                            but its power makes many advanced things more
                            difficult.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The type system is a bottomless pit. I've got type
                            inference 95% working, and there's no end in sight
                            for finishing the last 5%.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Targeting the browser as the primary platform has
                            caused a lot of complexity in the project structure,
                            but provides near-zero benefit so far.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Over the next days (let's be realistic: it'll take
                        weeks), I'll be going into each of those problems, and
                        how I intend to address them with the new prototype.
