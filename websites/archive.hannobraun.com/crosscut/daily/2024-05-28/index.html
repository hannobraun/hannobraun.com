                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                    <p>
                        My approach to incremental development requires the
                        ability and willingness to keep evolving the language
                        over time. I'm not working towards a big 1.0 release,
                        after which the language will be "stable", with few or
                        no breaking changes ever again. Maybe that will happen
                        one day. But currently, it's not part of the plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And I don't think that's a bad thing. I think a
                        programming language is too big of a target to be
                        "stable" indefinitely. And lots of languages acknowledge
                        that; with gated feature, unstable flags, editions, or
                        2.0 releases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would like to embrace breaking changes in Caterpillar.
                        Treat them not as something to be avoided, but as an
                        inevitable part of the process, that the language and
                        tooling are designed to make painless. There should be
                        no need for a big 1.0 release, and then another big, and
                        very painful, 2.0 some time after.
