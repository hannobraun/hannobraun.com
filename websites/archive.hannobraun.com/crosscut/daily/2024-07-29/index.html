                        So what does it mean to have a code database? It means
                        that the canonical version of your code, what you store
                        in your version control system, is not plain text files,
                        but a structured database. A plain text representation
                        of the code can still exist, as an input format for the
                        developer, but what gets stored is structured data that
                        is already parsed and partially compiled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inference of types, effects, and other information, can
                        happen during that partial compilation step. Meaning the
                        inferred information is stored in the code database. If
                        you modify the code, and that results in a change to an
                        inferred type, that change shows up in the diff of your
                        commit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's also a performance benefit. The code database
                        serves as a cache. Every build becomes an incremental
                        build; even the initial build after you clone a
                        repository. (Although that doesn't include any
                        compilation steps that happen afterwards, like code
                        generation for the target platform. I don't know yet,
                        how that is going to fit into the bigger picture.)
