                        I've been talking about <a

                        >rewinding</a> for a while now. I believe that it will
                        be an essential ingredient for interactivity and the
                        immediate experience that I'm aiming for, so it's going
                        to be a priority soon. Although I'm still working on
                        static typing. And fixing some of those nasty bugs in
                        the debugger is actually more important than either. Oh
                        well, lots to do.

                    <p>
                        One important aspect of rewinding is I/O which,
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-12-03"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >as I explained</a>, is represented in terms of effects.
                        This is not the only thing that effects are used for.
                        The other big use case are errors. In essence, an effect
                        is just a thing that, when executed, stops the program,
                        returns control to the host, and tells the host about
                        the nature of the effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the effect is an error, then currently that's it. The
                        program is over, and the developer can decide to
                        restart. (Rewinding is going to change that though.) If
                        the effect is a call to a host function, which is how
                        I/O is implemented, then the host can do whatever that
                        host function does, put the results on the stack, and
                        resume the program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's more potential here though, which is what I'd
                        like to talk about next.
