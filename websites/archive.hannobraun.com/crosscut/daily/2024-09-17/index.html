                        I believe that

                            types as more than just text</a>. But I don't think
                        it's enough to just build vectors into the language and
                        hardcode how to render them into the tooling. This might
                        work for vectors, but the concept is applicable to so
                        much more. It needs to be extensible by the developer.

                        Understanding a geometric algorithm using vectors, is
                        going to require a much different graphical
                        representation than understanding a sorting algorithm.
                        And maybe a much different representation than a
                        different geometric algorithm also using vectors. I
                        think trying to solve that at the language level would
                        be of limited benefit.

                        I believe the visualizations need to be defined at the
                        library level. The language just needs to provide common
                        infrastructure that libraries can build on, and that the
                        tooling can understand, without having to know the
                        specifics of the library.
