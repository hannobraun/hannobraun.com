                        Code updates are very buggy right now, and even after
                        more work,
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-09-30"

                        >will remain imperfect</a> for a while. For the time
                        being, the developer will be expected to keep an eye on
                        things, and restart the program from time to time, as
                        necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The easier problem to solve, is certainly that we can't
                        just keep appending new code. Initially, I want to
                        implement a code size limit, and after that's reached,
                        the program just has to be restarted before live updates
                        can resume. Longer-term, this can be solved using
                        garbage collection of old code, and some kind of
                        defragmentation maybe. Not rocket science, but it will
                        take time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bigger problem is that new code might expect or
                        produce different types than the code it replaces. This
                        currently leads to undefined behavior, and there's no
                        easy solution for that. We need a static type system to
                        detect it, and I expect that to become a priority pretty
                        soon. Then we can at least detect the problem and
                        restart. Longer-term, more sophisticated handling should
                        be possible.
