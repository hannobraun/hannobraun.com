                        So yeah, I kinda couldn't control myself and
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-12-26"

                        >mostly implemented type inference</a> over the last few
                        weeks. This wasn't exactly the highest priority, given
                        all those bugs in the debugger, but I think that's fine.
                        I'm not as intent on quickly getting to a state of
                        productive use as I used to be.

                    <p>
                        For a while, I was focused on that very consistently.
                        That was very good for the project, but I haven't been
                        able to keep it up. Since then, things in my life have
                        shifted a bit, affecting the relative importance of
                        Crosscut versus other projects. I can't focus on it as
                        much as I used to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I still want to make progress every day though, and the
                        easiest way to do that, is to work on what excites me.
                        Which is certainly not the most effective way to make
                        progress, but as long as things move in the right
                        direction, I'm happy with that, for now.
