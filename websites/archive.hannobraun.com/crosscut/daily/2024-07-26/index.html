                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        >Closures</a> are currently boxed (i.e. allocated on the
                        heap), so they can be represented by a single value on
                        the stack. I don't think there's much to do about that,
                        while the language is still untyped. With a more
                        sophisticated type system, it will be possible to have
                        closures live on the stack, with no extra heap
                        allocations necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And there are other sharp edges. A closure is consumed
                        (its heap allocation is removed) when evaluated by
                        something like <code>if</code>. But nothing prevents you
                        from copying the value that represents the closure and
                        try to use that again. Or make up a completely new value
                        that then might or might not refer to a closure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right now, there's not much point in trying to fix stuff
                        like that, I think. Things will get better, as the
                        language develops. It's a process.
