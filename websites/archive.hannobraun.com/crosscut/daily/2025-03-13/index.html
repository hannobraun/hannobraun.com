                        variants for now. That's a topic for another day.) I
                        initially thought, that all nominal types should be
                        private by default. I even considered (and that's still
                        not off the table) to call the <code>nominal</code>
                        keyword <code>opaque</code> because of that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Making <code>nominal</code>/<code>opaque</code> have
                        this double meaning would not be very
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-02-28"

                        >orthogonal</a>, but that might be a worthwhile
                        trade-off. It would avoid having field visibility as a
                        separate feature. Fields that should be accessible, can
                        be made so by adding a function that makes them so. It
                        would make the overall system much simpler.

                    <p>
                        Such a design would also set a tone. It could encourage
                        safe abstractions, as opposed to APIs whose correct
                        operation is the user's responsibility. I'm all for
                        that, but I can also see how it could backfire. There is
                        such a thing as
                        <em>too much</em> abstraction. Then again, maybe I don't
                        need to worry about that, if structural types and public
                        fields are the much more accessible default.
