                        I started talking about algebraic effects

                        >almost two full weeks ago</a>! As might be obvious by
                        now, I think they are quite interesting and have a lot
                        of potential in Caterpillar and beyond. However, they
                        are not without problems. Let's start with the fact that
                        an effect triggered by a function you call, can skip
                        over your code and be handled by one of your callers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Won't that make code hard to follow? I don't think so.
                        Remember, Caterpillar is designed with a <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-07-29"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >code database</a> in mind. Which call could trigger
                        which effects would be inferred before the code goes
                        into the database. That information would be an integral
                        part of the code, and an editor would show it to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that can be as obvious as it needs to be. In Rust,
                        passing on an error can be automated using the <code
                        >?</code> operator. As far as I can tell, that's
                        generally considered to work well. In Caterpillar, we
                        could have something similar, except that the developer
                        would never have to type it. And we could tune it to
                        stand out more or less, as required.
