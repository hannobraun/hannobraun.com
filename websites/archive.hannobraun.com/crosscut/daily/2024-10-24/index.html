                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        One of the use cases that I had in mind for Caterpillar,
                        from early on, is microcontroller firmware. I have
                        worked in this field in the past. I know it can be
                        fiddly. And that your code runs on another device
                        doesn't make it easier. Debuggers can help, but the
                        available options never felt satisfactory. Although
                        maybe that's an issue with working off the beaten path
                        (I used Rust).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe that interactive programming could be a huge
                        boon there. And having this in mind has already driven a
                        lot of my thinking about Caterpillar. I've known for a
                        while that it can't end up as some dynamically-typed,
                        high-level thing. I want it to be competitive on devices
                        that run at a few MHz and measure their RAM in
                        kilobytes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And maybe such a focus would fit my life better
                        <a

                        >than game development does</a>. So much of what I've
                        doing (and dreaming about doing) over the last 10 or so
                        years has been about making physical things. Maybe,
                        instead of supporting firmware development at some point
                        down the line, it would be a good idea to focus on it as
                        the primary use case, starting right now.
