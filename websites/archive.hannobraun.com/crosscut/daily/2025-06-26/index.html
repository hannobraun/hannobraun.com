                        Let's get right to the point: I'm quitting. I already
                        came close last week, feeling overwhelmed by the
                        challenges of working on Crosscut, and pessimistic about
                        its outlook. I didn't do it then, because giving up on a
                        long-term project due to a temporary mood would be
                        stupid. But I'm doing it now. Because that mood,
                        temporary as it was, brought something into focus that I
                        can't ignore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To work on something big and ambitious, I think you need
                        a certain degree of blind optimism. Informed optimism
                        just won't do it, if the project is too big to hold in
                        your head all at once. So ambitious, that you can't even
                        imagine all of the steps you still have to take.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that little crisis of confidence, it shattered my
                        blind optimism. Permanently, I believe. Because it
                        reminded me that I have built my life around working on
                        big and ambitious projects, and that (so far) none ever
                        worked out. More importantly, it made me realize that
                        while I've gotten much better at doing them, maybe that
                        was the wrong lesson to learn.
