                    <p>
                        Over the last few days, we've looked at several of the
                        ad-hoc effects in Rust. First <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-12-13"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        ><code>Result</code> and panics</a>, then
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-12-14"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >asynchrony</a>. Armed with that knowledge, we can now
                        imagine a unified system that includes the most powerful
                        aspects of all of them, and can support any kind of
                        effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's what such a unified system could include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It would use a side channel to transport effects,
                            instead of return values. The caller doesn't have to
                            know about the effect, and a handler can sit
                            anywhere in the call chain.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Handlers themselves can trigger the effect (or any
                            other), allowing for nested handlers that can make a
                            decision at their respective level.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any code that triggers an effect can be resumed
                            afterwards, if the handler decides it's appropriate.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        A language that has such a system, could use it to
                        provide all kinds of effects. The ones I already
                        mentioned, but also I/O could be covered by effects.
                        Randomness could be, making it easy to control where
                        that's important (think multiplayer games). In Rust,
                        <code>unsafe</code> could be one! Imagine using that to
                        easily sandbox any dependency you don't trust.
