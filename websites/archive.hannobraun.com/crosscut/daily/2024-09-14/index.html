                        I think eventually, I want to build a custom editor for
                        Caterpillar. Maybe that's stupid and unrealistic. Even
                        if I build one, it might just be an intermediate step
                        towards full-featured support in existing IDEs.

                    <p>
                        But Caterpillar is definitely <a

                        >not a traditional language</a>. And I want to go quite
                        far with what the tooling provides to the developer. I
                        think extending an existing IDE would be quite the pain.
                        And especially while we still figure out what the
                        tooling needs to be like, a custom editor might be a
                        better vehicle for experimentation.

                        We'll see. For now, we have the debugger. The code it
                        displays is already based on an intermediate
                        representation from the compiler, which I've designed
                        with a code database in mind. That's the starting point.
                        Maybe it will be quite natural to slowly extend that
                        with editing capability here or there, until it can take
                        over as a primary driver during development.
