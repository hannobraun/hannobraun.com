                    <p>
                        Yesterday, I talked about stepping backwards in a
                        debugger. There is an inherent overhead to this. Not
                        only do you need to generate the instructions to do this
                        on the fly, you also need to store them. And computers
                        can execute a lot of instructions in a short time, so
                        such an "undo instruction" buffer might get quite long.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm not too worried about the performance overhead of
                        logging the undo instructions. For now, performance is
                        not a priority anyway. And I have ideas on how to
                        alleviate, and in many cases completely eliminate, the
                        overhead. Maybe I'm being too optimistic, but either
                        way, that's a topic for another day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently more worried about the length of the undo
                        buffer. It would need to be limited, and on
                        memory-restricted platforms (consider microcontrollers),
                        it might have to be quite short. This restricts the
                        usefulness of this feature, but I have ideas on how to
                        get around that too.
