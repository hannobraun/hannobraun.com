                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                    <p>
                        People have told me, in the context of other projects,
                        that I have to take into account feature X or Y from day
                        one, because it will be impossible to retrofit later.
                        I'm sure people will tell me the same about Caterpillar,
                        eventually. And I think they would be wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now let me be clear: It totally would be better if I <em
                        >could</em> consider all relevant design decisions from
                        the beginning. But there are so many open questions, so
                        much to figure out, that it's just impossible to juggle
                        all of it. I just <em>have</em> to defer some decisions,
                        or I'd get nothing done,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Will that lead to problems down the line? Yes,
                        absolutely. But is all hope lost, if I ignore certain
                        things early on? No, I don't buy that. It might require
                        partial rewrites, a lengthy refactoring process, a new
                        version that looks very different from earlier ones. But
                        there's always a way out.
