                        >yesterday's note</a> on how having a code database
                        affects changes to syntax, I had a realization. Not a
                        completely new one, but some puzzle pieces that I had
                        been thinking about separately suddenly snapped together
                        in my mind: If code shown to the developer is just a
                        rendering of an underlying representation, we're
                        basically halfway to visual programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, visual programming as it's commonly understood,
                        combining graphical boxes that represent pieces of code,
                        is something I'm very skeptical of. I've never used an
                        implementation that I actually liked. Then again, my
                        exposure to it has been very limited, and was basically
                        non-existent in the last decade or so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I guess that's a gap in my education that I should try
                        and fill. But either way, I think it's reasonable to
                        imagine a middle ground. Code as text, yes, but maybe
                        formatting it with more than just whitespace. Maybe <em
                        >do</em> draw a box around something here or there, to
                        show the relationships between those words in the code a
                        bit better.
