                    <p>
                        I've been talking about postfix operators for days now.
                        If you've already been familiar with them before, then
                        you might be surprised that I haven't mentioned the
                        stack once. I did that to keep my explanations simple,
                        but also to make a point. We can develop an intuition
                        for this, without constantly thinking about the stack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those not familiar, the evaluation model behind
                        postfix operators is a stack. Let's consider a simple
                        math example again, <code>1 2 +</code>. We can say that
                        <code>1</code>
                        is a function which puts <code>1</code> on the stack.
                        The stack contains <code>1</code> afterwards. After
                        <code>2</code>, the stack contains <code>1 2</code>.
                        <code>+</code> is a function that takes two numbers from
                        the stack, and puts their sum back (the stack contains
                        <code>3</code> afterwards).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The stack <em>is</em> important. It's how this model is
                        implemented behind the scenes, and it's a method for
                        understanding how it works. But my point is, we don't
                        need to constantly think (and talk!) about the stack.
                        Just like we don't constantly think and talk about
                        graphs, when working with operations involving infix
                        operators.
