                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        The current Caterpillar prototype is focused around the
                        question, if a debugger is a practical solution for
                        getting the language to a useful state relatively
                        quickly. A debugger needs breakpoints, and right now
                        those are implemented by always checking between
                        instructions, if there's a breakpoint at the current
                        one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which is fine, for now. But it seems like the kind of
                        thing that the language won't be able to afford in the
                        long-term, for performance reasons. So today, I had this
                        idea: If the language is interactive anyway, meaning I
                        can deploy code into the running program, then why don't
                        I just deploy new code that implements the breakpoint?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then breakpoints would only cause overhead right where
                        you need them. Which would still leave the overhead of
                        the interactive runtime, of course, but since that is
                        the central premise of the language, I'll have to make
                        that work
                        <em>somehow</em>.
