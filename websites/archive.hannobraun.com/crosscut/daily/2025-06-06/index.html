                        If I could start developing games with Crosscut right
                        now, somehow, that would

                        >solve a lot of problems</a>. Derisk the overall
                        project. Improve the outcome, by incorporating real
                        experience along the way. Possibly even contribute to
                        funding. But that doesn't answer the question of how to
                        do that. As I said before, <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-06-04"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's where I had a technical insight: Crosscut is
                        written in Rust, and through a translation layer,
                        Crosscut code can interact with Rust code. The
                        implementation of Crosscut itself and the core game
                        engine code live below that layer, as Rust code. And so
                        far, I intended all game-specific code and some
                        auxiliary engine code to live above this layer, as
                        Crosscut code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But nothing stops me from moving this translation layer
                        upwards. Have all engine code and most game code in
                        Rust. Only use Crosscut for a bit of scripting here and
                        there, to make some things easier to tweak in an
                        interactive way. As Crosscut matures, I could expand its
                        role in my games. Until finally, it becomes possible to
                        write a whole game with it.
