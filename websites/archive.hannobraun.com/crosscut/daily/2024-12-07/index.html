                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        >Effects</a> in Caterpillar happen under the hood. They
                        are implemented in the runtime, and the compiler knows
                        about them, but they are not a part of the language.
                        They are an implementation detail. But that could
                        change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At a minimum, it would be possible to annotate functions
                        with the effects they could have. So if a function calls
                        a host function that triggers a "write file" effect, for
                        example, then the function could be annotated as having
                        that effect. And any function that calls it (and any
                        function that calls <em>that</em> function,
                        recursively), would be annotated with that effect too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then you could look at a part of your program (or your
                        <code>main</code> function, if you want to look at your
                        program as a whole) and see what kinds of I/O it could
                        potentially do, and what kinds of errors it could
                        potentially trigger. But by itself, this is of dubious
                        value, as I intend to explain tomorrow.
