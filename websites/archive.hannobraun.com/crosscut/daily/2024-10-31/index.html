                        I believe it is rather simple (which doesn't mean easy!)
                        to create a differentiated product for a business
                        market: You pick a niche audience, figure out what
                        problems they have, and then you build a product that
                        solves one of those problems in a more targeted and
                        specific way than an established product from a bigger
                        player could.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since problems in a business probably cost that business
                        money, they tend to be willing to <a

                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >spend money to solve them</a>. Meaning you might be
                        able to charge a decent price for your product,
                        regardless of whether it is complex or was difficult to
                        make (especially if you have expertise that makes the
                        product hard to replicate for someone else).

                    <p>
                        Add to that, that in a hardware product, firmware only
                        constitutes part of the overall complexity (next to the
                        actual hardware and possibly other software), and you
                        can suddenly see how

                        >a new language for developing firmware</a> could fit
                        into such a scenario. Even if it's a bit too new to
                        support more sophisticated use cases.
