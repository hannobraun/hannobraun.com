                        I'm working towards a first milestone that would make
                        Caterpillar at least minimally usable for simple games.
                        And
                        <a

                        >I'm spending more of that time on foundational work
                            than I expected</a>, as opposed to new features that
                        would be relevant to users. I guess the milestone is
                        going to be less rickety than I expected it to be, but I
                        worry that it's also going to take longer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And I worry that I'm jumping into this foundational work
                        too quickly. That I don't see easier approaches, which
                        could provide user-visible benefit faster. I want
                        developers to work with Caterpillar as soon as possible,
                        so its continued development can be informed by actual
                        use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But that foundational work is not useless. The game used
                        to run very slowly on my laptop, which made performance
                        a priority for the milestone. I made some changes to the
                        guts of the language, which I expected to improve
                        performance. But that wasn't the focus yet. Now the game
                        runs fine. I expected that to be one of the more
                        difficult tasks before the milestone, and it got done by
                        accident.
