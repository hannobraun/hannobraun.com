                        As I said yesterday, Caterpillar is currently very
                        confusing and hard to use. I've run into this problem
                        with many previous prototypes. It seems you just need a
                        critical mass of language features that promote clarity,
                        until you cross some threshold where the language
                        becomes productive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what if I have tooling that tells me exactly what's
                        going on at runtime? Will that, by itself, make an
                        otherwise confusing language practical to use? This is
                        not a ridiculous thought, I think. People write
                        non-trivial stuff in assembly languages. Presumably, at
                        least in some cases, with the help of debuggers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm wondering if developing a debugger first is a more
                        practical path to productivity, than reaching this
                        critical mass of features. If so, I could have a usable
                        language from early on, and could take my time expanding
                        it. Only adding features incrementally, as I deem it
                        necessary and appropriate. But I need to figure out if
                        this approach can work, and that's the focus of the
                        current prototype.
