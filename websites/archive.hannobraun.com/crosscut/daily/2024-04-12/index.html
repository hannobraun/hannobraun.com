                        I think it is a mistake to give a language inherent
                        capabilities, that then might or might not be available
                        on the platform where you actually want to run it. Look
                        at Rust's standard library, for example. It's not
                        available at all on microcontrollers. It is available in
                        WebAssembly, but then some things just don't work (like
                        <code>print!</code>) or you might get an error when
                        using others (like threads). And yet, it is the baseline
                        that most Rust code is written against.

                        I really like what <a
                            href="https://www.roc-lang.org/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >Roc</a> does instead: Code inherently can't do
                        anything, except pure computation. If it wants to do
                        I/O, anything that relies on platform capabilities, it
                        specifies the I/O primitives it needs as arguments.
                        These I/O primitives are provided by something called a
                        platform, which is basically a framework that runs your
                        application, and you have to pass those primitives on to
                        the libraries you want to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, libraries end up much more portable (in
                        principle; I don't know, about the specific
                        implementation in Roc). A library can't just use the
                        filesystem. It can at most expect to use something that
                        looks like a filesystem. As long as what you give it has
                        the correct interface, you can make that do whatever you
                        need. Store "files" in your microcontroller's flash
                        memory, for example, or in RAM.
