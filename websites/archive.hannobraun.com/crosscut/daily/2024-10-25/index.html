                        The decision I'm currently considering, to

                        >switch to microcontroller firmware</a> as the primary
                        use case for Caterpillar, it's not a done deal. It does
                        seem to make a lot of sense, but there's a part of me
                        that isn't convinced yet. And that's fine. I like to sit
                        with these kinds of decisions for a while, to make sure
                        I'm not making an impulsive one.

                        >I rarely play games these days</a>, and consider many
                        of them a harmful waste of time, there's something that
                        still grabs me about that world. Because games
                        definitely have artistic merit. And there are those that
                        have really resonated with me. That I have gotten more
                        out of than I put in, in a sense.

                        I started doing game development in my teens and had
                        ambitions, lasting into my early thirties, to make that
                        my career. That ended in failure. Almost everything I
                        worked on was too big to ever get finished. Maybe
                        there's a part of me that doesn't want to let go of the
                        past. That wants a chance to do it right this time.
