                    <p>
                        Last week, I wrote about that ugly debugger I wrote for
                        the current Caterpillar prototype. I still needed to
                        make some improvements to the debugger and the language
                        runtime, but I was finally able to debug that broken
                        code I had sitting in a local branch.
                    </p>

                            src="debugger.png"
                            alt="A screenshot of a browser window containing Caterpillar's debugger"
                        />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The debugger is still ugly as hell, but it's starting to
                        shed some light on the core questions that the current
                        prototype was created to answer: Yes, it seems practical
                        to build a debugger for Caterpillar. Yes, this debugger
                        makes it practical to work with a language that is
                        otherwise very confusing.

                    <p>
                        My next goal is to further substantiate these answers,
                        by writing more code. What I currently have just draws a
                        white background into a window. I want to turn this into
