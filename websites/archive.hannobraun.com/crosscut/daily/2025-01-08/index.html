                        From the start, I've been organizing my work on Crosscut
                        as a series of prototypes. Whenever I felt that a path I
                        had taken wasn't great, and that another approach would
                        be more promising, I wasn't shy about
                        <a
                            href="https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/tree/main/archive/prototypes"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >archiving</a> what I had to start fresh. Because
                        Crosscut was never about a specific implementation. It's
                        about a vision of what programming can be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project has benefited greatly from this approach.
                        It's almost absurd to imagine where things would have
                        gone, based on my initial set of ideas. Most likely, it
                        would have gone nowhere, and I would no longer be
                        working on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And now I started working on a new prototype! As I've
                        come to realize, the previous one has quite a few
                        problems, that I might be able to avoid using a
                        different approach. But I'm not fully committed yet. For
                        now, the new prototype lives in a separate directory,
                        and I haven't archived the previous one. I want to see
                        first, if the new prototype works out.
