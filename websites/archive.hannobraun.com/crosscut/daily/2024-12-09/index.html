                        The second reason that annotating functions with effects
                        may be of
                        <a

                        >limited use</a>, is that it would be noisy. Let's look
                        at division (the math operation) as an example. Dividing
                        can trigger the "divide by zero" effect. Any function
                        that divides, or calls a function (maybe transitively)
                        that divides, could trigger the "divide by zero" effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For certain kinds of code, that effect would be
                        everywhere. But annotating every function with it would
                        be useless. It would just be noise that tells me
                        <em>nothing</em> about how well I'm actually dealing
                        with the error. A solution to that could be dependent
                        types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm not ready to fully dive into dependent types right
                        now, but you can think of them as types that include
                        values. So instead of just saying <code>n:
                            Number</code>, you could say <code>n: Number and n
                            != 0</code> . If you then divide <code>x</code> by
                        <code>n</code>, you (and the compiler) would know, that
                        this can't trigger the "divide by zero" effect. Sounds
                        like that would make effects a lot more useful!
