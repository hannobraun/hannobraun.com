                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        Caterpillar has postfix operators, which imply a
                        stack-based evaluation model. But Caterpillar isn't a
                        stack-based language. (At least that's not what I would
                        call it.) Because, while there is a "data stack" that
                        functions operate on, it works differently than the data
                        stacks in the stack-based languages that I've seen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This starts with the name. I'm saying "data stack",
                        because the context here is the difference between
                        Caterpillar and stack-based languages. But that
                        expression isn't even used in Caterpillar. Here, the
                        values that are available to be operated on, are just
                        called the "operands".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One big difference between these operands and a typical
                        data stack, is that operands are local to a function.
                        When you enter a function, there are no operands. While
                        in a stack-based language, you'd have access to the same
                        stack as the calling function. That raises the question,
                        how are parameters passed in Caterpillar? I plan to
                        answer that tomorrow.
