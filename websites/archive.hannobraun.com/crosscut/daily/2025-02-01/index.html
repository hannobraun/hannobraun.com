                        The browser-centric architecture of the previous
                        prototype created
                        <a

                        >an ongoing burden</a> for me. But for the most part, it
                        wasn't the browser itself that caused that. Except for
                        making the debugger UI a bit more complicated than it
                        strictly needed to be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yeah, I had to figure out how to compile to WebAssembly,
                        but that's easy to do with Rust. Even going with a
                        purpose-built build tool and not using a binding
                        generator wasn't too big of a deal. The JavaScript glue
                        code was mostly a one-time investment, with little
                        ongoing maintenance required. All those are things that
                        I could easily do again.
                    </p>

                        What caused a huge burden, was putting the browser into
                        the center of the whole architecture. The game ran
                        there, the debugger ran there, live code updates were
                        applied there. And since the browser runs in a separate
                        process, that required a server; communication between
                        that, the game, and the build tool; serialization of
                        data structures; and so on. Lots of complexity that
                        wasn't actually required.
