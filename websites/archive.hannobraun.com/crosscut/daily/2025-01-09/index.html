                        So, I've <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-08"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >started working</a> on a new prototype. And if that
                        goes well, I will archive the previous one. After 8 to 9
                        months of working on it, that previous prototype was a
                        hot candidate for turning into the real thing
                        eventually. So why am I working on retiring it?

                        The general problem is that everything's taken longer
                        than I thought it would. And there's not really an end
                        in sight. Part of the reason is that over the last
                        months, I've been going down rabbit holes instead of
                        being laser-focused on what's most important.

                    <p>
                        But that's only part of it, and I have a list of quite a
                        few specific problems with the approach I've taken on
                        that prototype. Even if I strengthen my focus (which I'm
                        working), it would still take a long time before I can
                        use that prototype to participate in game jams
                        semi-regularly, which I hoped I'd be doing by now.
