                        >rewinding example from yesterday</a> has a lot of
                        overhead. A ratio of 5 undo instructions to just 3
                        regular ones! But it can be made cheaper by going more
                        coarse-grained. For example, the latter two instructions
                        <code>push 2</code> and <code>add</code>, as a unit, can
                        be undone with <code>push 2</code> and <code>sub</code>,
                        resulting in a 1:1 ratio. And a single <code>pop</code>
                        can undo all three together (1:3).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm not sure yet what to do with this insight. Maybe the
                        developer should have explicit control over how
                        expressions are grouped into "undo units". Or the
                        compiler could decide, based on some set of rules I have
                        yet to work out. Guided by configuration that, for
                        example, could limit the ratio of undo instructions to
                        regular instructions.

                    <p>
                        I don't know. But I think this is one of those cases
                        that I can work out when I actually get to it. And in
                        any case, it's best to keep the initial implementation
                        simple; just log undo instructions per instruction.
