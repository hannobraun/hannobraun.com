                        I've decided that a fully inferred static type system is

                        >not worth the trouble</a> right now. I'll have another
                        go at it later, but then I'll (initially) require every
                        single expression to be annotated with a type signature.
                        That's going to be bad, but from there, I can implement
                        type inference (and more complex type system features)
                        incrementally.

                    <p>
                        But before I go there, I've finally started looking into
                        deploying games written in Caterpillar to a website.
                        (Which should have been the highest priority for a while
                        now.) Of course, I already managed to get sidetracked.
                        Instead of just implementing deployment in a
                        straight-forward way in the custom build tool for the
                        Caterpillar repository, I started working on a
                        Caterpillar CLI tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's not too bad. Going that route probably wasn't
                        that much more work in the end. And a tool for
                        Caterpillar development, that you can use outside of the
                        Caterpillar repository, and without needing a Rust
                        toolchain installed, is going to be required anyway.
