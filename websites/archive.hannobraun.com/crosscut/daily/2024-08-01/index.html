                    <p>
                        I've been going on for a bit about how a code database
                        can apply to specific aspects of Caterpillar. I've said
                        it before, but the inspiration for the code database
                        comes from <a
                            href="https://www.unison-lang.org/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >Unison</a> (and to a lesser extent <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >Smalltalk</a>). And Unison gets a lot out of the way
                        they implement this, that I haven't mentioned so far.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Unison, code is content-addressed. Meaning each piece
                        of code is hashed, and referenced via this hash. This
                        approach has a lot of advantages. The Unison
                        documentation already does a good job of explaining
                        that, but over the next few days, I'd like to go over
                        some of those advantages, and how I think they apply to
                        Caterpillar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And by the way, while Caterpillar doesn't have a code
                        database yet, it already implements the hashing and
                        content-addressing. This has turned out to be useful for
                        implementing interactive programming (as demonstrated by
                        a previous prototype), and I've recently re-implemented
                        it in the current version.
