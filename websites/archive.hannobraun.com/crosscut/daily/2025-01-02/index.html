                        I can think of <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-12-31"

                        >two approaches</a> for editing a structured code
                        database. I'm not sure which one is better. From an
                        idealistic perspective, a custom editor seems superior,
                        but it would also be a lot of work to get right. Work
                        that could be spent elsewhere. The "checkout" approach
                        allows for re-using existing infrastructure, but doesn't
                        come for free either.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm not at all sure where I'll land on that. Maybe start
                        with the checkout approach as a stopgap, with the
                        long-term goal of having a custom editor. But who knows.
                        Either way, today I'd like to start thinking through how
                        having a custom editor affects what syntax is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the checkout approach, I think the role of syntax
                        doesn't really change. You still have a plain-text
                        representation of the code, used both for displaying and
                        editing. That's no longer the <em>source</em> code, but
                        I don't think that changes anything fundamentally when
                        it comes to syntax. A custom editor, on the other hand,
                        does change things fundamentally. I'd like to dive into
                        that tomorrow.
