                        >lots to consider</a> about rewinding I/O effects.
                        What's clear, is that different effects have to be
                        treated differently, and that the host has to provide
                        that information. So this is going to be one of the
                        things that has to be part of the interface that the
                        compiler and/or runtime can use to query the host.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Things get even more complicated, if the developer
                        rewinds over an effect, makes changes, then moves
                        forward again, re-running the modified effect. Again,
                        there are easy cases. If the effect is a sound, just
                        play the modified sound. But if it's a network request,
                        the server might or might not handle a second, different
                        network request well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the host doesn't know (because it allows generic
                        network requests and has no understanding of the
                        protocol), then I guess a general fallback would be to
                        ask the developer what to do. Or refuse to do anything
                        without restarting the program. So rewinding won't
                        always be a completely smooth experience. But I hope it
                        can be smooth enough to make it a big win overall.
