                        After the latest improvements to the debugger, I've been
                        able to make significant progress on the game side.
                        There's basic user input; there's game state, updated in
                        an ongoing simulation that considers input; and there
                        are simple graphics to display all that. What's still
                        missing to complete the game, is some kind of challenge,
                        and win/lose conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is definitely the most advanced thing I ever wrote
                        in any version of Caterpillar (although the language
                        itself was more sophisticated in earlier prototypes).
                        Which further strengthens the hypothesis, that a
                        debugger is both practical to implement, and sufficient
                        to tame a very basic language that would otherwise be
                        too confusing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keeping the language so basic, was a decision made to
                        keep the current prototype manageable. But I'm now
                        considering to deviate from that plan. Working with
                        Caterpillar was an interesting (if tedious) puzzle at
                        first, but it's starting to grate on me. I think putting
                        some work into the language itself might be a good
                        investment right now.
