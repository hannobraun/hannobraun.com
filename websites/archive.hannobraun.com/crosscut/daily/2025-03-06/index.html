                        In addition to <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-03-05"

                        >records</a>, I had also planned to have tuples in the
                        language. A tuple would have been much like a record,
                        except that its fields were to be anonymous, meaning
                        they wouldn't have names. And without names, the order
                        of fields would have to be significant, while in a
                        record, it is not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But having both records and tuples seems to go against
                        the spirit of
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-02-28"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >"simple, orthogonal, and composable"</a>. Wouldn't it
                        be more orthogonal and composable to just have records,
                        but allow their fields to be anonymous? But then we'd
                        have fields where ordering is important mixed with
                        others where it's not. We could make all fields ordered,
                        but that seems limiting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The solution is as simple as it is (in retrospect)
                        obvious: Don't have tuples (and any anonymous fields) in
                        the language. (This idea came from a conversation with
                        <a
                            href="https://adriansieber.com/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >Adrian Sieber</a>, who started helping me with language
                        design.) You can always use a record with fields like
                        <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, or something along those
                        lines. In view of that alternative, I don't think that
                        tuples carry their weight.
