                        Not everything in my life is as secure as I want it to
                        be. My

                        >current source of income</a> is one example. And while
                        I handle this well (it doesn't cause me stress), it did
                        result in some mental overhead. Whenever there was a
                        significant change, I started reconsidering my options.
                        Thinking about if and when it would make sense to change
                        my approach.

                        A few months back, I decided that I should deal with
                        this problem in a more principled manner. So I sat down
                        and developed a clear and actionable Plan B, for what I
                        would do if my income failed. More importantly, I set
                        objective criteria for when Plan B would activate. Right
                        away, that provided a lot of clarity.

                        And there was a secondary effect, also positive. In
                        multiple ways, that Plan B would present a clear cut for
                        me. Away from frivolous pursuits, towards more serious
                        efforts that had a better chance of sustaining me
                        (financially) in the short term. This mirrored <a
