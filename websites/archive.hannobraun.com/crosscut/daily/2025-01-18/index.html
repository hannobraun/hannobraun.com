                        An early lesson I learned while working on Crosscut, is
                        that making a programming language is easy. It's just
                        very, very hard, to then turn it into something that you
                        can use productively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe the central problem of programming, is to
                        understand what's going on. What your code is doing.
                        Without the kind of infrastructure that a mature
                        programming language brings to the table, this can be
                        difficult. Add to that, that earlier prototypes used a
                        pure concatenative model; no variables, unlimited access
                        to the stack; and the problem became <em>very</em>
                        challenging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My answer to that, was to add a debugger. And not as an
                        afterthought; I started a new prototype with one built
                        in from the beginning. Overall, this has been a success.
                        It solved the problem. It allowed me to actually work
                        with my immature, unwieldy language. But <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-10"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >nothing's perfect</a>, of course, and the debugger has
                        also been a source of problems.
