                        Yesterday,
                        <a

                        >I declared "strong, dynamic typing" to be an
                            intermediate goal</a>
                        for Caterpillar. I know this is going to confuse some
                        people, so let's clear up a mistake I see sometimes:
                        "Strong typing" is not the same as "static typing".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Static (vs dynamic) typing means, that types are known
                        at compile-time. I don't know of such a concise
                        definition for strong and weak typing, but strong
                        basically means there are clear distinctions between
                        types, while weak means there are shenanigans like
                        unchecked or implicit conversions between types. All
                        four combinations between static/dynamic and strong/weak
                        can exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rust is static and strong. JavaScript is dynamic and
                        weak, due to its many weird and implicit rules. Many
                        scripting languages are dynamic, but strong. I'm told
                        Python is an example of that. C is static, but weak.
                        Types are known at compile-time, but you can always just
                        cast one type to another, without restriction. To C,
                        it's all just bits.
