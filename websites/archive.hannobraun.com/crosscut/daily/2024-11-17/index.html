                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        At some point, the host could be a concept that
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-11-16"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >only exists at compile-time</a>. Well, at least as far
                        as Caterpillar-specific functionality is concerned.
                        There would still be some kind of generic, 3rd-party
                        host that Caterpillar code interacts with. In the form
                        of an operating system, or the hardware directly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But bridging between the platform and Caterpillar code
                        is not all that the host does. It also manages the
                        communication between the (host-agnostic) runtime and
                        the debugger. And that is essential, since immediacy and
                        interactivity form Caterpillar's central premise. This
                        is also code that the compiler could be taught to
                        generate, of course, but I wonder if there's a better
                        way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe I can define a standard interface for the
                        host-specific features that support interactivity. The
                        communication with the debugger, and updating code. Then
                        this could be implemented in the runtime and linked into
                        the program. Or, even better, it could be implemented in
                        Caterpillar code, and live alongside the regular code
                        for the Caterpillar program.
