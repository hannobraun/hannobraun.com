                        Type inference of recursive functions is

                        >causing me a lot of trouble</a>. And I haven't even
                        mentioned mutual recursion yet! That complicates things
                        further, of course.

                        After I gave up on processing branches based on a queue
                        (for now; maybe I'll give it another go later), I've
                        been looking into building a call graph of branches
                        involved in recursion, and figuring out the right order
                        of processing based on that. I already tried it earlier,
                        before looking into the queue-based approach. Now I've
                        come back to it, with some new ideas.

                        But first, it's compiler cleanup time again! So far,
                        anonymous functions are being handled in a very
                        sub-optimal way. I didn't notice, because it hasn't been
                        causing any major problems. But with this new challenge,
                        the issue has become obvious. So yeah, that's were I'm
                        at right now. I'm sure it'll work out one way or
                        another, and a cleaner compiler pipeline is always a
                        nice bonus.
