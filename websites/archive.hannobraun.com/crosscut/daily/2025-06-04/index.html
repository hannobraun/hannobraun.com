                        If Crosscut is to become a successful tool for
                        developing games, then I need to
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-06-03"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >develop games</a> with it. To generate real-word
                        experience that makes Crosscut better, and to market it,
                        to show that it is indeed a viable tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point, this line of thought runs into a bit of a
                        hurdle though. I
                        <em>can't</em> develop games with Crosscut. It's not
                        ready. And since I started the latest round of
                        prototypes in early January, development has progressed
                        at a glacial pace. Currently, it seems like it might
                        take forever to support full games, beyond maybe the
                        most basic ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which is fine. I <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-17"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >expected that</a>. But I'm still getting antsy. I'm
                        worried that I'm going to work forever on this one big
                        thing, only for it to fail at some point, for some
                        reason, leaving me with little to show for my efforts.
                        How can I avoid this risk, without compromising on the
                        project's core vision? I have some thoughts, which I'm
                        going to share tomorrow.
