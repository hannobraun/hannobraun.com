                    <p>
                        When I talked about the concept of "solid" and "fluid"
                        code yesterday, I glossed over one thing. I said you
                        could change the boundary between solid and fluid code
                        on the fly, but that would still require machinery that
                        you can connect to and deploy new versions with. Would
                        that still be zero-overhead?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe not, but I don't think it matters. If you're
                        deploying to a server, you would have some means to
                        upgrade your application in any case. If you're
                        deploying to microcontrollers, you might have a
                        bootloader that you can use to upgrade your firmware
                        over the network. In these situations, you have that
                        overhead anyway. It just moves from SSH, or whatever
                        you're using, into the language runtime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That still leaves some other cases, like
                        function-as-a-service platforms, or deeply embedded
                        systems that don't allow upgrading the firmware. If
                        you're running something like that, and you can't afford
                        the additional overhead, there could still be a
                        "all-solid/no-updates" fallback mode. This would
                        basically be the same as deploying any other compiled,
                        non-interactive language.
