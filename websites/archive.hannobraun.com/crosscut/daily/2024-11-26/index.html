                    <p>
                        Before I continue my musings on rewinding, here's a
                        quick update on the latest developments: I aborted my
                        attempt to implement a fully inferred static type
                        system. My hypothesis, that this won't be that hard for
                        a very basic type system, was clearly false. In fact, it
                        seems that type inference <em>requires</em> a minimum
                        threshold of type system complexity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One problem is that concrete types can not always be
                        inferred locally, within a function. Instead, you can
                        infer the most general type that would work there, and
                        later check that any arguments supplied to that function
                        meet those requirements. What I'm describing here are
                        basically generics, or some complex thing in the
                        inference algorithm that works around the lack of
                        generics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And there are other hurdles too. For example, if you
                        have a function that never returns, it doesn't really
                        matter which return type you annotate it with. But with
                        inference, you have to detect this case, and need to be
                        able to represent it in the type system (that's usually
                        called the "empty" or "never" type). I've decided that
                        at this point, all of that is not worth the trouble.
