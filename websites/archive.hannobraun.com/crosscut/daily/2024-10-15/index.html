                    <p>
                        Let's switch gears and think about maps for a second.
                        It's totally reasonable to store your data in one of
                        those, and just refer to it indirectly, via some kind of
                        handle that is associated with a value in the map. It's
                        also reasonable to expand on that. Create a special map
                        that generates a handle for you when you insert
                        something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe such a special map could even implement a strategy
                        for managing handles and values. Like making handles
                        unique, and requiring you to return the unique handle to
                        the map when you're done with a value. Or keeping track
                        of which handles exist, and when the last one for a
                        value is dropped, remove that value from the map.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suddenly, those special maps start to sound like heaps,
                        plus a strategy for managing the memory there. But
                        neither of those would be built into the language. They
                        could very well be implemented in a third-party library.
                        So
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-10-14"

                        >maybe Caterpillar will have references after all</a>.
                        They might just come in the form of handles into various
                        maps.
