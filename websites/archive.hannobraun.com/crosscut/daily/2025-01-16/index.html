                        The idea of immediacy, that you make a change and see
                        the result in your program without delay, that's the
                        central premise Crosscut. This is expressed as
                        interactive programming. And yet, I started the previous
                        prototype without that feature. Based on experiences in
                        an even earlier prototype, I had considered that a
                        solved problem, to the limited extent that it had been
                        relevant so far.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-10"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >that was a mistake</a>. I implemented interactive
                        programming later, as an afterthought, and it ended up
                        not working very well. It was missing the features
                        required to make it work well with the language that had
                        developed up to that point. And on top of that, the
                        earlier prototyping had been more limited than I had
                        realized, which caused problems of its own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such a central feature must be there from the beginning.
                        Everything else that is being added, needs to adapt to
                        it. Then I can keep it working all the way through, as
                        the language grows around it. The <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-08"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >new prototype</a>
                        is starting out with exactly that premise.
