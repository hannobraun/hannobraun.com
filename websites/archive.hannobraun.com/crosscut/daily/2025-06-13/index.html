                        This series of notes <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-06-09"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >started with</a> "How do we access record field? Maybe
                        use functions." and <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-06-11"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >went on to</a> "How do functions even work?". Now my
                        latest drafts, which are currently a few days ahead of
                        what I already published, are getting into "How does
                        type inference interact with traits?", which is pretty
                        far of from where I started.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think it's time to take a step back, recognize that
                        I'm in for more than I bargained for, and reconsider how
                        to continue. But this endeavor has been useful in one
                        respect: If I had to implement records soon, I now know
                        that I would just introduce special syntax for that.
                        It's a good-enough placeholder, and anything else would
                        be too complicated for now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that out of the way, I'm not sure what to do. Maybe
                        dive head-first into Pandora's box and attack some of
                        those gnarly questions that have started to claw their
                        way out. Or maybe go with an easier topic first, while I
                        think some more about those questions in the background.
                        I guess we'll see tomorrow!
