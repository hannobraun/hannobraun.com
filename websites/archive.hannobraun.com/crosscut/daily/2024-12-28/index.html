                        Comments are much better supported now. They were
                        already fully supported in branch bodies. In addition,
                        the parser has been accepting them in front of named
                        functions for a while, but those were just thrown away
                        and not rendered in the debugger. Now they are stored in
                        the syntax tree, as are comments on branches. Although
                        both are still not rendered in the debugger yet (<a

                        Comments on named functions and branches are actually
                        associated with that named function or branch in the
                        syntax tree (as opposed to being stored as an
                        independent element). Making that work, while still
                        keeping the language grammar

                        >LL(1)</a>, required changes, which then triggered
                        further changes, to make things more consistent. I'll
                        talk about that tomorrow.
