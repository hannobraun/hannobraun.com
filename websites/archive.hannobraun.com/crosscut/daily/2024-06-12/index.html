                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                    <p>
                        I mentioned yesterday, that Caterpillar is edited
                        outside of the browser, on my native system. Changes to
                        the running program will have to be sent into the
                        browser, via a development server. This isn't the only
                        way I could do it, and I'd like to talk about that
                        today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Long-term, I expect things to work differently. Instead
                        of editing plain text files, I want to store source code
                        in a structured code database (similar to
                        <a
                            href="https://www.unison-lang.org/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >Unison</a>). Users would edit that code database
                        directly, via custom tooling, including a custom editor.
                        All of that <em>could</em> run in the browser, but the
                        database could function as a distributed version control
                        system, exchanging code with nodes running elsewhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That approach has too many benefits to ignore, but it's
                        also going to take a lot of work to get there. And in
                        the meantime, I want Caterpillar to function. Which
                        means integrating with traditional tooling, like editors
                        and version control systems. These run on traditional
                        operating systems and expect code to be stored in plain
                        text files. So that's how Caterpillar is going to work
                        too, for the time being.
