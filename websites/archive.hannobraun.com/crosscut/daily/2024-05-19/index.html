                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                    <p>
                        Right now, I'm focused on addressing technical risks to
                        Caterpillar's success. But I think the only way to know
                        that we really turned the corner, is for the language to
                        have actual users. People that prefer to work with
                        Caterpillar, over the other options available to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And since I have to start somewhere, I'm thinking I'll
                        keep it simple and start with myself. Make myself the
                        first user of Caterpillar. That seems kinda obvious. Of
                        course I'm going to be the first to write code in the
                        language I create. But being a real user includes the
                        "prefer it over other options" bit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want to get to a point where I genuinely want to work
                        with Caterpillar, independently of my desire to improve
                        it. Just because I prefer the experience of working with
                        it over the experience of working with Rust (or whatever
                        else). If I can get to that point, that would be a
                        strong sign that I'm on to something.
