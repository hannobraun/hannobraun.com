                    <p>
                        Over the last few days, I've been talking about linear
                        types in general. But the reason I mentioned them
                        initially, was the role they can play in purely
                        functional I/O. Let's see how that can work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's say you call a function that writes to a file, and
                        that file is represented by an opaque value. You need to
                        pass that value to the function. Now you can't use that
                        value ever again, so if you want to read from the file
                        afterwards, that function needs to return an updated
                        value to represent the file after the write. And you
                        pass that to a second function, that reads from it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, it is now easy to keep track of what's
                        happening and when, both for the developer and the
                        tooling. You see exactly what path the file takes
                        through the functions that operate on it, and in which
                        order those operations happen. If, for example, the
                        runtime decided to run some of that code in parallel, it
                        knows exactly where it can do that, and what needs to
                        stay serial.
