                        I'd like to conclude this long series on the new
                        prototypes, by saying that I'm fully aware that I'm
                        setting myself up for some of the same problems that
                        <a
                            href="https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/tree/main/archive/prototypes/11"

                        >prototype 11</a> had. Then, I hadn't built a code
                        database, despite considering that a central feature.
                        This led to a situation where all design decisions I
                        made where either <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-11"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >suboptimal or preliminary</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm going to run into similar problems again, for
                        example with the type system. My plan is to have a
                        static and linear type system, and yet I've decided to
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-30"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >go with a dynamic one</a> for now. I'm sure this will
                        cause the same kinds of problems that I had with the
                        code database previously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it's going to cause those problems in an area that's
                        less central to my vision (although still very
                        important). And I don't think that can be avoided. I
                        can't make everything perfect from day one, so I have to
                        draw the line somewhere. But I'll have to prioritize
                        this soon. Even before other work, that might have a
                        more positive impact in the short term.
