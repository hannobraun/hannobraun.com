                        neat. It would re-use a concept that already needs to be
                        in the language anyway. And it would introduce
                        compile-time code execution, which is a powerful tool
                        that can be useful in many scenarios.

                        As I said yesterday, I haven't worked out all the
                        details yet. But here's how that could look like, maybe:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
<code>module {
    # Insert some code here; calculate some constant values, for example.

    # At the end of the module, we return what we want to export.
    {
        TheThing: # insert some data type here
        read_from_the_thing: # insert a function here
        write_to_the_thing: # another function goes here
    }
}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Probably more than anything, this is inspired by
                        old-school JavaScript, before modules where supported in
                        the language. Back then, we could build our own module
                        systems, based on functions that returned objects of
                        things they wanted to export. (Well, we still can. It
                        just makes less sense these days.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe this is the wrong inspiration for a language that
                        is supposed to be statically typed and compiled, at some
                        point. But right now, I can't see why it wouldn't work.
                        We'll see!
                    </p>
