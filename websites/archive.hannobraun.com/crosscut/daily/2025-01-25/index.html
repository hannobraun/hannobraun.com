                        The evaluation model of the previous prototype (which
                        resulted from my choice of postfix syntax) caused many
                        problems. I've already
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-24"

                        >presented some examples</a>. And I swear, the plan up
                        until yesterday, was to present you with the solution I
                        had chosen, right here and now. I have a fully written
                        draft! But no, not today, as it turns out ðŸ˜„

                    <p>
                        When I made the choice to start a new prototype, I knew
                        that I wanted to keep the syntax easy, for the time
                        being. A known quantity. And my first thought was to use
                        <a

                        >S-expressions</a>, or something closely inspired by
                        them. As time went on (it's already been three weeks!),
                        I changed my aim towards a model more inspired by the <a
                            href="https://www.haskell.org/"

                        For reasons I won't go into today, I have doubts about
                        both models. Meanwhile, I had started thinking about a
                        new concept based on postfix syntax. This morning, both
                        those doubts and my ideas about the new concept reached
                        a critical mass. And I'm no longer sure what to do.
