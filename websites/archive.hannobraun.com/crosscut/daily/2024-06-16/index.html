                        Sometimes I write these daily notes on the day they come
                        out. But unless the topic is an update on current
                        events, it's more likely that I have a queue that's a
                        few days long. Then I just give a final polish to the
                        next note before publishing it, and spend the bulk of my
                        writing time for that day on the rest of the queue.

                    <p>
                        A few days ago, when I wrote the note that was
                        originally supposed to come at this point in the series,
                        I was worried about scope creep in the debugger. How can
                        I prevent that from spiraling out of control? Is there a
                        more minimal approach that I am missing?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And somehow, the mere act of writing these questions
                        down, <em>instantly</em> triggered new ideas on how to
                        simplify the debugger, making it less of a burden going
                        forward. I've already implemented some of them. <em
                        >That</em> is the reason I write these daily notes!

                        them yet ðŸ˜‚)
