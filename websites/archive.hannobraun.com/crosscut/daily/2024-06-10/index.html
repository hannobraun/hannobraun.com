                        The new focus is to implement interactive programming.
                        But before I launch into that directly, I want to pave
                        the way with a bit of cleanup first.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was able to port the game to the browser so quickly,
                        because of a heavy stack of dependencies that I was
                        already using, and that happen to work in the browser
                        too. This setup is quite bloated (manifesting in slow
                        compile times). It's also designed for running Rust in
                        the browser, not to support a whole new language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of that is probably fine for now, so I want to be
                        opportunistic about this cleanup. Simplifying now saves
                        time later, but it's not worth getting stuck on. Since I
                        don't know how long this will take, nor how much time it
                        can save, I don't have a strict limit. As long as
                        there's progress and I'm happy, all is good. If I'm not
                        done in a few weeks, I can re-evaluate.
