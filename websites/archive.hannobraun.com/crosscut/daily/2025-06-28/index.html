                        I'm not completely sure yet what's next for me. I mean,
                        I still have
                        <a
                            href="https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >my other big project</a>, of course, which in contrast
                        to Crosscut has some amount of ongoing funding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do know that my ambition to create a better way to
                        write software, is still well and alive. Along with my
                        conviction that interactivity, immediacy, the shortest
                        possible feedback loops, are the way to achieve that.
                        But I'm not going to keep expressing that ambition by
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-06-27"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >working on a huge project</a> that might not work out.
                        And even if, probably won't see any success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll have to figure out the details as I go. But I do
                        know, whatever comes next, and however much of Crosscut
                        is in that, it will be a small, achievable project. And
                        so will the next one. Maybe my projects will grow again,
                        over time. But only once I've earned it. When I can
                        build on previous steps that already work, instead of
                        having to jump right into the deep end, with little
                        preparation.
