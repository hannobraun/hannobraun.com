                    <p>
                        I have one last note on the topic of
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-09-01"

                        >developer experience versus performance</a>. While the
                        focus on developer experience probably means that
                        Caterpillar is not going to be the best language to get
                        that last bit of speed out of an algorithm, I don't
                        think it's going to make Caterpillar programs slow in
                        general.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, the whole point of a good developer experience
                        is to make the process of software development more
                        pleasant, and thus more productive. Better productivity
                        can mean you have time left to optimize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, to improve developer experience, I would like to
                        provide tools to help the developer understand their
                        program better. Including its performance
                        characteristics. All that could lead to a language that
                        is quite fast in general, simply because developers have
                        the tools and the spare resources to make it so. Even if
                        it can't quite compete with Rust or C in <em>peak</em>
                        performance.
