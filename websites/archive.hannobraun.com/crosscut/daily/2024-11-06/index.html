                        I think it's time to post a quick update about what I'm
                        currently working on. First, what I <em>should</em> be
                        working on, is implementing a way to deploy Caterpillar
                        games to a website. That has been at the top of my list
                        for a while. Right now, you only can run your game
                        through a local development server that's included in
                        the Caterpillar repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I'm working on <em>instead</em> is a static type
                        system. When I started to consider <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-10-22"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >an immediate switch of focus</a>, I figured it might be
                        nice to make sure the Caterpillar runtime can run on
                        bare-metal targets. I've long wanted this, both for
                        future-proofing, but also because it's connected to some
                        simplifications I would like to make.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Getting that done was basically just a formality, as the
                        runtime is pretty much isolated from anything else
                        already. But it still allocates dynamic memory, which I
                        also want to avoid. And even though
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-11-01"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >I'm not going to switch focus</a> for the time being,
                        I'd still like to simplify the runtime. Which means the
                        compiler needs to become smarter.
