                        I think it's important to consider the defaults we are
                        setting, and what those defaults are going to mean for
                        how the language will be used. (I
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-03-13"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >alluded to that</a> before.) And I think I want
                        Crosscut to be a language that <em>allows</em> you to
                        build airtight abstractions where that makes sense, but
                        that doesn't <em>push</em> you into doing that.

                        >separate concepts</a> might be the best option in that
                        regard. Each would be available to you, as a tool in
                        your toolbox, but they wouldn't impose on you. You
                        wouldn't feel forced to make every API restrictive from
                        the start, doing more harm than good.

                        The natural way of doing things would be all structural,
                        all public. Which might lead to a rather relaxed style
                        of building APIs, where everything goes. But where it
                        makes sense, you can reach for specialized tools to tie
                        things down. Who knows if this is how it'll actually be;
                        but I like the thought.
