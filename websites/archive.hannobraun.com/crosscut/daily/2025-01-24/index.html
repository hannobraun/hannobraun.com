                        In a stack-based evaluation model, expressions <a

                            rel="noopener noreferrer"

                        instead of a tree. That does have some subtle but
                        profound consequences, as the flow of data becomes more
                        complicated to keep track of. For the developer, but
                        also for algorithms that need to process code. This
                        causes problems.

                    <p>
                        A minor (but I think still important) one, is automatic
                        formatting. If your expressions form a tree, that's
                        straight-forward: A node's children are indented one
                        level more deeply than the node itself. If they form a
                        graph, that approach won't work. You'll need more
                        complicated measures than that, to express the
                        dependencies between expressions visually.

                        Another problem is type inference, which is already a
                        difficult topic, inherently. Making the flow of data
                        more complicated, makes this hard problem even harder.
                        Or, how do you express that a function doesn't return?
                        If you don't have a single return value, then you can't
                        just declare that as having an
