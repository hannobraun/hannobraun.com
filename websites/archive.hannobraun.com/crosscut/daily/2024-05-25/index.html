                        My decision to focus on language improvements for a bit
                        was a good move, I think. I've already implemented
                        bindings (which are commonly called "variables", in
                        imperative programming languages) and started to
                        refactor some of the code to rely less on stack
                        operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was surprisingly easy. And while all bindings are
                        currently mutable and global, which is the opposite of
                        what I'm going for, and they are not displayed in the
                        debugger, I think I have a good handle on how to address
                        each of those shortcomings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now, I'll continue refactoring the game code. Then
                        I'll decide whether to continue with language
                        improvements, or move on with the original plan and
                        finish the game. Maybe bindings give me enough of a
                        boost to power through. Or it could make sense to
                        further improve bindings, or implement modules.
