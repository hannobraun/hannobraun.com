                    <p>
                        I'm a big believer in automated testing, but there's a
                        time and a place. Many projects require a phase of
                        exploration, as you figure out the shape of the thing
                        you're building. Tests only get in the way then (at
                        least in my experience). The current iteration of
                        Caterpillar has been in such an exploration phase, and
                        so I didn't write any tests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which was fine, but I think I missed the transition
                        point from exploration to engineering. My recent work on
                        the core language has broken many features in the
                        periphery. The snake game only partially works now,
                        crashing the moment I press a button. And I can't fix
                        that, because the debugger has deteriorated too, to the
                        point of being unusable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Time to roll up my sleeves, fix some bugs, and make sure
                        that each feature I'm fixing gets covered by a test. I'm
                        working hard on making Caterpillar usable for real
                        projects, and while it will be a long time before the
                        language is truly mature, there is only so much breakage
                        I am willing to tolerate.
