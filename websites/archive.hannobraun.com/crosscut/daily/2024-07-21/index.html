                    <p>
                        There are many trade-offs in language design. Here's one
                        example: Do you favor explicitness, which makes it more
                        obvious what's going on, hence making code easier to
                        read; or implicitness, which reduces the amount of code
                        you need, thus making it easier to write.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want to try and sidestep this trade-off in
                        Caterpillar, by explicitly designing it to be used (and
                        read) with tooling. If that works out like I hope, we'll
                        get ease of writing <em>and</em> ease of reading,
                        because everything can be implicit and inferred, but
                        still clearly visible in the code as you work with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But that's just a different trade-off, and you pay for
                        that one by making Caterpillar less readable where tool
                        support is missing. Like when you read code on a site
                        like GitHub. I think the upside of designing the
                        language with tooling in mind will be worth it, but
                        we'll have to see where exactly to draw the line.
