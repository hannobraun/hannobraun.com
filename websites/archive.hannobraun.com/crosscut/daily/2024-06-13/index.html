                    <p>
                        Last week, I <a
                            href="https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/tree/main/archive/prototypes/10"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >finished working on a prototype</a>, one of the main
                        goals of which was to create a simple game. And building
                        the language (plus tooling) that game is written in, in
                        parallel. Which is why it took a few months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This game is definitely the most sophisticated thing
                        I've ever written in Caterpillar, with any of its
                        prototypes. Even though some of those earlier prototypes
                        featured a more advanced language. And that was a
                        practical thing to do. I could use this version of
                        Caterpillar to build another game of similar complexity,
                        with relative ease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the point of the prototype was to answer specific
                        questions, and I have to admit, I'm a bit confused about
                        those answers. Going into that though, will require a
                        few more words than I want to make space for here. It's
                        a topic for tomorrow!
