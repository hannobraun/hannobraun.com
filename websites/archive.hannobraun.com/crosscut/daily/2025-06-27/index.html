                        I have built my life around working on big and ambitious
                        project. Projects that, so far, never got finished, but
                        that still consume all of my potential. To the detriment
                        of ever doing much that is useful, for others or for
                        myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't think the reason for that is too much
                        incompetence on my part. I'm certainly no genius, but
                        I'm probably not that much dumber than most people who
                        live more successful lives. No, I think it's just the
                        nature of what I'm doing. If you work too far outside of
                        your current capabilities (which is what big and
                        ambitious projects require), you are likely to fail.
                        Simple as that.

                        I realize that my <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-06-26"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >decision to quit this project</a> might seem sudden.
                        But I've been thinking and journaling about this for
                        near two weeks now. I don't like to make these kinds of
                        decisions too quickly. But I'm also not the type to burn
                        myself out, trying to hold on to something that's
                        already gone.
