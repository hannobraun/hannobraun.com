                        effects, so let's take a look at that today.

                        What I'm going to talk about here are "algebraic
                        effects". What that basically means (according to my
                        limited understanding), is that effects become a
                        first-class concept in the language. Something that the
                        developer can define and handle themselves. As opposed
                        to all effects being built into the language, and
                        handled only by the host.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Allowing that has some profound consequences. Remember,
                        effects stop execution and turn over control to a
                        handler (currently the host), which can then resume
                        execution after doing whatever else, or not. This is a
                        very powerful ability, that can be used to implement
                        features like exceptions, async/await, and many other
                        things, without any special support from the language.

                    <p>Starting tomorrow, I'd like to dig into that further.</p>
