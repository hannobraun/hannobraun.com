                    <p>
                        As of a few days ago, the debugger had a component
                        called the "code explorer". It's where you could see all
                        your code, and set breakpoints anywhere. It wasn't very
                        good. Now it's gone, and if you want to set a breakpoint
                        in code that's not already in front of you, you just go
                        into your editor and add a call to <code>brk</code>
                        there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It also had an "execution context" which, if the program
                        was currently stopped, showed the current function where
                        it was stopped. Next to that, there was a call stack,
                        which displayed the chain of functions that led to the
                        current one. Both of those are now gone, in favor of a
                        single view of "active functions".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have another idea, on how to simplify the way that the
                        data function calls operate on is displayed. That will
                        further reduce the debugger's surface area, and thus the
                        maintenance burden going forward. I'm very happy about
                        that. I have the best chance at success, if I can pare
                        what I already have down to its most minimal form.
