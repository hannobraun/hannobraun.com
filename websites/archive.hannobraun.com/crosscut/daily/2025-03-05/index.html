                    <p>
                        I think that I've come up with a design for data types
                        that is
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-02-28"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >simple, orthogonal, and composable</a>. Let's get into
                        it, starting with records:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>record { value: Integer, unit: Text }</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        A record has multiple fields, each of which has a name
                        and a type. It's a composite (or compound) data type,
                        meaning it's a single value that bundles multiple other
                        values together. This kind of thing is often called
                        "struct", "class", or "object" in various languages. In
                        terms of programming language theory, this is called a
                        product type.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like the name "record" (inspired by <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >Pascal</a>), because it's easy to understand, and
                        doesn't seem to come with a lot of baggage. "Class" or
                        "object" come from the object-oriented world, which
                        would be misleading. "Struct" would be familiar to many,
                        but as a name it seems overly broad. (Many data types
                        could be "structures", I think?)

                        Records are (by default; I'll expand on that later)
                        <a

                        >structurally typed</a> and anonymous. You could assign
                        a name to a record by returning it <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-03-02"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >from a module</a>, for example, and refer to that name
                        from elsewhere. Or you could define a record directly in
                        those places, anonymously.
