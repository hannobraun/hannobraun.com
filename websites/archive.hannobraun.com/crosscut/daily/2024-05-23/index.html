                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        I have big ideas that I want to see realized in
                        Caterpillar. But I have to spend my limited resources
                        wisely. And I'm absolutely convinced that iterating on
                        something basic that works, will lead to a better result
                        than building up to some grand vision, without tangible
                        benefits on the way there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means I have to define milestones that provide
                        those tangible benefits. And it means I have to decide
                        what <em>won't</em> make it into a milestone. Which is
                        going to be most of what I eventually want to achieve.
                        As a result, these milestones will look very different
                        from the desired end result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And sometimes, I might need a placeholder. For example,
                        if I decide we need better types, but a static type
                        system is too much work for now, I'll go for a dynamic
                        one. Which is a totally different direction from where I
                        want to go eventually. This might look like wasted work,
                        but I don't think it is. Not having a working product to
                        incrementally improve on, would be worse.
