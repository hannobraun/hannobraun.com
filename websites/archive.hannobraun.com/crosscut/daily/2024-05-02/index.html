                        I've been talking about the distinction between "solid"
                        and "fluid" code. Solid code is compiled, optimized, and
                        might take a few seconds to deploy a new version of.
                        Fluid code is fully interactive; but how would it be
                        implemented?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It could be bytecode, run by an interpreter. Maybe even
                        just-in-time-compiled, for better performance, although
                        I have doubts that this is a path I want to go down.
                        Maybe it would still be compiled code, just not as
                        heavily optimized. Machine code in a form that is
                        similarly structured to the source code, so you can swap
                        a function for a new version, without having to undo all
                        kinds of inlining optimizations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't know what the answer is. For now, everything's
                        interpreted, and I guess that's a good place to start.
                        From here, I can expand towards more compilation and
                        optimization, incrementally, as the situation demands.
