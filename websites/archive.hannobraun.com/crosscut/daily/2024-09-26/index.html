                        If code is represented as text files, and we have a code
                        update, there's not much we can do except compare two
                        big blobs of code (either as text, or in its
                        pre-compiled form), to figure out what the specific
                        changes are between them. This is not only unreliable,
                        but also wasteful. Because

                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-07-29"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"

                        >custom editor</a> that updated the database directly,
                        we'd know about every single change as it happens. The
                        compiler would compile just the new code, and generate
                        code to transition from old version to new. There would
                        be no perceptible delay between finishing to type
                        something, and that making it into the live program.

                        Alas, the time has not come yet. Building the
                        infrastructure required for this would be a huge
                        distraction right now, and set any hope of productive
                        use back by months, at best. So I'm left with having to
                        find a technique that works well enough for now, based
                        on source code in text files.
