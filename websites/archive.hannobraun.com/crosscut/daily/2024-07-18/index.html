                        My work on Caterpillar has been a bit unfocused as of
                        late. I started working on re-adding interactive
                        programming, then got tired of that for some reason, and
                        switched to working on better conditionals. While I did
                        that, I was readily distracted by opportunities to
                        improve the architecture of compiler and interpreter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This isn't bad. These are all good and necessary things
                        that need to get done. But I also miss the experience of
                        following a plan, getting things done, crossing them off
                        my list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most important thing is that I have fun. Because not
                        only is that fun, it is also the best guarantee of
                        continued productivity. I think it would be ideal, if I
                        could find a way to do both: Make progress on a
                        sensible, linear plan; but also leave room for
                        meandering. Working on whatever currently interests me.
