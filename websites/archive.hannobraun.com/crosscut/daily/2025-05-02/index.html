                        I don't have experience with structural code editors. I
                        never worked in an environment that provided one. I just
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-05-01"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >determined</a> that I was going to need something like
                        that. And then I went ahead, starting to figure out what
                        to build, from first principles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My first approach was very free-form. You were editing a
                        syntax tree instead of text, but you weren't restricted
                        in how to do that. You could freely change existing
                        nodes, as well as add and remove their children,
                        parents, or siblings. Every time you did that, the
                        compiler would figure out if the result was valid, and
                        display the appropriate errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This worked well for a while. But as my basic
                        placeholder language grew into something that started to
                        resemble a real one, the free-form approach showed signs
                        of breaking down. The compiler became more complex, to
                        the point where I wasn't sure that I wanted to continue
                        along this path.
