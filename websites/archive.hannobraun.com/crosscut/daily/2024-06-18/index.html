                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        It's unlikely that Caterpillar will ever become
                        mainstream. I mean, that's an unrealistic expectation
                        anyway. Very few languages are. But even if I put in all
                        the required work, and had all the necessary luck, and
                        it gained a thriving community; even if all those
                        conditions were met, it probably still wouldn't happen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have too many wild ideas. Too many experimental
                        features that I want to try. Add to that, that I'm not
                        committing to backwards compatibility. I just don't
                        think that millions of developers from all over the
                        world will jump on the opportunity to work with a
                        language like that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that's fine. Caterpillar doesn't need that many
                        users to be successful. I would consider it a success
                        if, at a minimum, it becomes a good tool that I want to
                        use. Beyond that, I hope it can gain enough users and
                        provide enough value, that I can fund its continued
                        development.
