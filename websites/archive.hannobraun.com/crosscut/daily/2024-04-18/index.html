                        Let's talk about debuggers. I think there's a core set
                        of features that you would expect from one: set
                        breakpoint, continue execution, step over this
                        expression, step into this function call... you know,
                        the well-known stuff. But what about stepping backwards?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think to make Caterpillar truly interactive, this is a
                        feature we need. No more, "oops, stepped too far; guess
                        I'll have to restart". Instead, just rewind the program
                        whenever you want. Maybe make a change to the code. Step
                        forward again to observe your change. Repeat until
                        you're happy.

                        I think this might be quite straight-forward to
                        implement: For every instruction that gets executed, log
                        the instructions that would undo its effect into a ring
                        buffer. When stepping back, execute instructions from
                        that ring buffer. But I think there is more to consider
                        beyond this naive implementation, and that's what I'd
                        like to write about over the next few days.
