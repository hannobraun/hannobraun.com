                        There's one assumption in <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-08-25"

                        >yesterday's note</a> that I'd like to call out: The
                        easy fix for determining the active expression in a
                        reconstructed stack frame depends on functions having
                        exactly one exit point. If you allow early returns, then
                        functions can have multiple of those, and suddenly this
                        is no longer possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I use early returns in Rust, but discovered that they
                        are more controversial than I thought. Many seem to
                        favor coding styles that avoid them completely, claiming
                        it will lead to cleaner code. Even before I came across
                        call stack reconstruction, I had decided I wanted to try
                        that style in Caterpillar. Now it turns out, this is
                        critical for supporting this important feature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This leads into a larger theme: Restricting what the
                        language can do, making it more simple as a result, can
                        make it easier to understand. By the developer,
                        hopefully, but also by tooling (which then benefits the
                        developer indirectly). This is something that I want to
                        explore in the design of Caterpillar. The result will be
                        unfamiliar to many, but I hope lead to a better
                        experience.
