                        >previous prototype</a> was designed to answer specific
                        questions: whether keeping the language extremely
                        simple, and augmenting it with a debugger from the
                        start, is a good way to approach Caterpillar's
                        development. And as I teased yesterday, the answers to
                        those questions aren't as clear to me as I had hoped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, building a debugger was practical. No, the debugger
                        alone wasn't enough to tame the language in its
                        super-simple form. But then, implementing the additional
                        language features required to do that, wasn't too much
                        of a burden. Maybe it was unreasonable to limit the
                        language so much in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's not clear to me, if the debugger was <em
                        >necessary</em>. It took a lot of work to get it to its
                        current state. And it will take more work to keep
                        improving it, and to maintain its current functionality
                        as the language evolves. I could have invested that work
                        into language features instead, and maybe that would
                        have gotten me a better result.
