                        I've been working on Caterpillar for over a year now,
                        sinking countless hours into it. So far, I've seen it as
                        a side project. With long-term potential, yes, but
                        mostly as something to learn from and have fun with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This perspective is starting to change. I'm starting to
                        take the project more seriously. As a result of that,
                        I'd like to talk about it more. And I figure, if I want
                        to do so consistently, a daily cadence (mostly) is
                        probably easiest to sustain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is an experiment. I don't know for how long I will
                        want to keep doing it. And so I'm starting small, with
                        just a file in the repository. If this turns into
                        something real later on, I can take it to a website, an
                        email newsletter, maybe social media.
