                        In programming language design, there are these islands
                        of purity. Lisp, Forth, Smalltalk, probably others too.
                        Those are examples of language families that implement a
                        single concept without much compromise, resulting in a
                        simplicity that feels desirable. Early on in my journey
                        of working on Crosscut, I hoped that I would create
                        something comparably simple.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And it seems like that didn't happen. I just proposed
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-05-26"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >infix operators</a>, for crying out loud. But I'm not
                        sad. It's not like I tried and failed, after all. Along
                        the way, trade-offs presented themselves to me. And I
                        chose the options that steered the language away from
                        purity, and the simplicity that comes with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I <em>chose</em> not to create a Forth or a Lisp. (I
                        never considered to create a Smalltalk, although
                        Crosscut takes a lot of inspiration from it.) And I
                        guess I rediscovered why most languages are a mess: To
                        achieve purity, that needs to be a priority. Which means
                        you're going to make trade-offs that sacrifice other
                        desirable properties. Again and again, I wasn't willing
                        to do that.
