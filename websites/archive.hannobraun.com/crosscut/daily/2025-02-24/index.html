                        It is hard to imagine what Crosscut would look like, if
                        I hadn't followed the approach of experimenting with <a
                            href="https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/tree/main/archive/prototypes"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >many prototypes</a>. Most likely, I would have given up
                        on the project long ago (as I did on so many others). So
                        I think this prototype-based approach has been a
                        success. I would totally use it again on future
                        projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, there's a psychological element that
                        makes this approach difficult. I know, rationally, that
                        these prototypes have advanced the concepts behind
                        Crosscut, and have saved me from going down various dead
                        ends. But, at times, it can <em>feel</em> like I've been
                        going in circles without moving any closer to the goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I ended up abandoning the current prototype, that
                        would be progress. Because it would mean that I had
                        discovered and prevented another outcome that wasn't
                        viable. And that would be good. But at the same time, I
                        really hope it doesn't come to that. That the current
                        prototype finally is the real thing, and everything that
                        comes now can unequivocally feel like real progress.
