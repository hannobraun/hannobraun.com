                        A few months back, I <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-06-01"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >created a Plan B</a> for what I would do, if my income
                        failed. That plan would activate, if my income and
                        savings fall under a specific threshold, and would mark
                        a significant change in my life and efforts. Away from
                        endeavors I do largely for idealistic reasons, towards
                        work that would have a bigger chance of making money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That alone already helped a lot. I no longer need to
                        constantly re-evaluate, whenever something significant
                        changes about my situation. But it also shifted my view
                        on my current projects. Because I still have income, I
                        still have savings, which is why Plan B is not active
                        right now. And as long as it isn't, I can <em
                        >afford</em> to work on more idealistic efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I realized that, it changed how I thought about
                        Crosscut's use case. I started seeing game development
                        not as a mere stepping stone, chosen for its technical
                        merit. Something that I had to re-examine and question
                        every step along the way. But as something I would stay
                        with indefinitely, while Plan B was not active. A
                        serious goal in itself.
