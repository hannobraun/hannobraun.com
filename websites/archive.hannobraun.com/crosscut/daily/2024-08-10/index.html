                        So I was <a

                        shortcomings with it, and that I came up with an
                        alternative. Then I went into
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-08-09"

                        >detour on tail call elimination</a> to set the stage
                        for explaining all of that. That detour would have
                        continued to other topics, and gone on for multiple
                        days.

                    <p>
                        <em>Would have</em>, because while working on the drafts
                        for that, I found an error in my thinking. Basically,
                        the same technique I intend to use as part of my new
                        solution, could have been used to fix <code>if</code>.
                        Which is like 95% of the reason that I write these daily
                        notes. They help me think.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sure would have been nice to have had this insight
                        before I spent about a week implementing pattern
                        matching in function definitions to replace <code
                        >if</code>, but hey, that's how it goes sometimes. And I
                        like the new solution better anyway, for various
                        reasons, so no harm done (except to my schedule).
                        Anyway, still a lot to explain about all that, so I
                        guess that's what I'll do over the next few days.
