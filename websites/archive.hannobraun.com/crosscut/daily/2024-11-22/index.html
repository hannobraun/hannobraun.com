                        The approach of <a

                        >logging "undo instructions"</a> to get the ability to
                        rewind the program won't work as described, if
                        implemented in the current runtime. The problem is that
                        executing instructions is currently not atomic. For
                        example, the <code>add</code> instruction might pop its
                        first argument from the stack, before noticing that
                        there is no second argument left.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we don't take this into account somehow and log
                        instructions to undo the partially executed
                        instructions, rewinding won't work from such a state.
                        Which is relevant, because hitting some kind of error
                        condition is probably going to be one of the prime
                        reasons to want to rewind in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's unclear to me how big of a problem this actually
                        is. Once static typing is implemented, the case I
                        described here can't happen anyway, because the compiler
                        would notice the missing argument and not generate the
                        <code>add</code> instruction in the first place. But
                        still, it would be nice to just never have to worry
                        about this causing any potential problems. I'll have
                        thoughts on that tomorrow.
