                        tackle syntax and evaluation model together, since they
                        are closely related.

                    <p>
                        From the start of the project, I was going for a syntax
                        based on postfix operators, and a stack-based evaluation
                        model. I

                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >wrote about this decision</a> before. Going through
                        these old notes (from 8 months ago!), I still largely
                        agree with the points I made then. (Although I have new
                        thoughts, which I hope to get into at a later date.)

                        But despite all attractive qualities, this approach
                        caused two major problems. First, what I was trying to
                        build was very different from anything that exists (as
                        far as I know). This turned every hurdle into a major
                        design challenge. Second, this model, despite its
                        simplicity, is quite powerful. Which is nice. But that
                        power came back to bite me later, when working on the
                        type system.
