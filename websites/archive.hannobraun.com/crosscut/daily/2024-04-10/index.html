                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                    <p>
                        My vision for Caterpillar started with interactivity,
                        but that's not where it stayed. I've developed many more
                        ideas that I want to realize with this project. And
                        since I've been using Rust as my primary language for
                        over 10 years, it's my frame of reference. I can't help
                        but think of Caterpillar as an evolution of Rust. A
                        simpler and more powerful form of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think it's possible to get Rust's core benefit, memory
                        safety without runtime overhead, in a much simpler
                        language. A functional language that does away with
                        mutability, hence mutable references. In fact,
                        performance consideration that the compiler can take
                        care of under the hood aside, a reference is basically
                        the same as a clone, so I think we can avoid them
                        completely! (This is not my own idea. I got it from <a
                            href="https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >HVM</a>.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Rust without references doesn't need a borrow checker,
                        which is one of its most complicated parts. We can get
                        all the benefits with just a linear type system, but
                        none of the other complications. I can't know for sure
                        that this will work out, but I'm optimistic. It's one of
                        the many things that excite me about Caterpillar.
