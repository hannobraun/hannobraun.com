                        I'm sure there are many approaches for implementing

                        >expression-level rewinding</a>, but the ones I could
                        think of all boil down to a single principle: While you
                        evaluate expressions, you log the information you need
                        to undo those expressions later. Who does that logging,
                        and what specifically is being logged, that's where the
                        differences are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for who does the logging (or more precisely, who's
                        responsible for making sure it happens), there are two
                        candidates: the runtime and the compiler. I think having
                        the compiler do it is more attractive overall, because
                        that makes it easy to disable, leaving no runtime
                        overhead; and because it's still going to work once
                        Caterpillar is compiled to machine code (or
                        WebAssembly).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But having the runtime do it might be the more practical
                        option in the short term. As far as I can tell, that
                        could be a relatively simple and robust solution, while
                        having the compiler orchestrate it would be more
                        complex, with more moving parts. Over the next few days,
                        I'll be looking into this a bit more deeply.
