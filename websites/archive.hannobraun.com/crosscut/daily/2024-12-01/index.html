                        >compiler-orchestrated rewinding</a>, I've been talking
                        about "undo data" in addition to "undo instructions". In
                        an interpreted environment, just generating the
                        instructions that undo the regular instructions seems
                        like the most straight-forward approach. But when
                        compiling to WebAssembly, I don't think this would work
                        without jumping through hoops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Generating static undo instructions at compile-time, and
                        then at runtime just filling a buffer with arguments for
                        those static instructions, seems like the more portable
                        approach. I haven't tried it yet, but I'd guess that
                        would work in pretty much any compiled environment.
                    </p>

                        Seeing it laid out like this, it becomes very obvious
                        that there's quite a bit of overhead here. It kinda
                        seems to not matter with an interpreter, since that's
                        slow anyway. (In reality, it still matters of course.)
                        With compiled code, the additional overhead can't be
                        hidden. It's very obvious. But it can be reduced, which
                        is what I'd like to talk about tomorrow.
