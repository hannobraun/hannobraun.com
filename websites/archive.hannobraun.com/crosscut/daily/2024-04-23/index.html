                    <p>
                        I've been talking about how to step through Caterpillar
                        programs, forward and backward, undoing and redoing
                        changes to their state. But so far, I've completely
                        glossed over the topic of I/O. How would that interact
                        with such a capability?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Graphics are typically re-rendered every frame, based on
                        the current frame. So it wouldn't matter in that case.
                        File I/O could work, if instructions/events carry enough
                        information to rewind changes there too. With a log
                        file, you could acknowledge the rewind by logging a
                        message about it, then just continue from there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What's not at all clear to me, is how to hook I/O into
                        this whole system in the first place. It seems pretty
                        straight-forward on the instruction level. But what
                        about Event Sourcing? That's designed to explicitly <em
                        >not</em> do any I/O when applying events. More to think
                        about, for sure.
