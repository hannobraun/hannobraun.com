                        Caterpillar will be a functional language. There are
                        many ways to define and explain this, but here's my
                        favorite perspective: Everything that your code does is
                        locally visible. So if you look at a piece of code, you
                        won't be surprised by its behavior. All it <em>can</em>
                        possibly do, is encoded in its arguments and return
                        values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is not just good for your, the developer's,
                        understanding of the code. It also helps the machine.
                        I've <a

                        >mentioned rewinding</a> before, but there are other
                        cases where this is useful. A compiler or interpreter
                        can look at a piece of code, and immediately decide what
                        can be run in parallel, for example.

                        I've been talking about <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-07-04"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >tracking I/O</a>, and this is what I mean by that. If
                        I/O is to happen, it can't just be hidden inside of a
                        function. It must be visible outside of that function.
                        In its signature, ideally even in the code that uses it.
                        There are multiple ways of achieving that though, and
                        I'd like to talk about those over the next few days.
