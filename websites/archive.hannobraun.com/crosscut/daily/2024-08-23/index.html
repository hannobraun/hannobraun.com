                        >is currently untyped</a>. This means that everything is
                        a 32-bit word, and depending on which function you call,
                        the arguments will get interpreted as whatever types the
                        called function expects. This isn't ideal, but it's
                        simple and was easy to implement.

                    <p>
                        The end goal is a static type system, but I expected to
                        have a dynamic type system on the way there, as an
                        intermediate step. I no longer think this is going to
                        happen. It seems more likely, that we'll transition from
                        untyped to static typing directly. As it turns out, "no
                        type system" and "static type system" are pretty
                        similar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In both cases, the runtime knows nothing about types.
                        Whatever typing exists, the compiler keeps track of.
                        Right now, this means the compiler keeps track of no
                        types at all, but it's easy to imagine how that can
                        change gradually. From this perspective, a dynamic type
                        system seems like a detour. It would require significant
                        changes to the runtime, which would then get reverted
                        again later.
