                        covering Haskell's monad-based approach, and the simpler
                        approach based on values and linear types that I want to
                        go with for Caterpillar. I've also said that I/O in
                        Caterpillar is represented in the form of

                    <p>
                        Right now, this is an implementation detail. What's
                        unclear to me, is whether those effects are going to be
                        present in the type system, in the form of algebraic
                        effects. Those are pretty neat, and they can be used for
                        a lot of things; from I/O, to error handling, and much
                        more. But in each of those areas, they compete with
                        simpler language features, like plain values.

                    <p>
                        I'm sure I'll have more to say about algebraic effects
                        in the future. (I have drafts for a whole series of
                        daily notes about that.) For now, I just wanted to
                        quickly mention them, as they relate to the topic of I/O
                        in functional languages. If you want to learn more in
                        the meantime, I recommend you check out the
                        documentation of <a
