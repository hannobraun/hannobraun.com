                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        If you had the greatest team of all time, and you set
                        them to work on the wrong things, then their output
                        would be worthless to you. And very likely, that would
                        not be obvious for a good while. Going fast into the
                        wrong direction can feel very productive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And I don't have the greatest, or any, team. It's just
                        myself, for the time being. So it's critical that I
                        don't waste my efforts. That I spend my limited
                        resources where it counts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's why I always try to think about what is important
                        to work on right now. Questioning whether what I'm doing
                        is actually advancing Caterpillar in a direction that
                        matters. I'm honestly not sure how well I'm doing that.
                        But I guess time will tell, one way or the other.
