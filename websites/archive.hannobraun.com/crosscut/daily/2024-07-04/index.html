                        >concept of a "host" in Caterpillar</a> is inspired by

                            href="https://www.roc-lang.org/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >Roc</a>. Roc calls it "platform", but there are other
                        differences too. I don't think Roc has the same focus on
                        effects that can be tracked, for example.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another difference (as far as I know) is, that as far as
                        Caterpillar is concerned, access to heap memory is I/O.
                        This has some advantages. Dynamic memory allocation is
                        not desirable in every situation (think
                        microcontrollers, for example). Not treating access to
                        the heap as the default case, will help make Caterpillar
                        code more portable.

                        It's also likely to be more flexible. Some platforms
                        have multiple different kinds of memory. Again,
                        microcontrollers come to mind; but WebAssembly also has
                        something like this in the pipeline, as far as I know.
                        Not building too many assumptions into the language,
                        about how memory works, is likely to make it more
                        flexible in handling non-standard cases.
