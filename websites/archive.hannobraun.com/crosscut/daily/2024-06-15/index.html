                    <p>
                        Yesterday, I mused whether building a debugger was
                        necessary, and if the same amount of work, applied to
                        other features, would have gotten me a better result. I
                        don't know. And I doubt that spending 2-3 months to
                        start a new prototype from scratch, to answer that
                        question, is worth it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whatever the answer is, it's undeniable that the
                        debugger is useful. It's also undeniable that it opened
                        my mind to the possibilities of custom tooling. I now
                        firmly believe that more of that is in Caterpillar's
                        future. But when is the right time to invest in it? That
                        is the big question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now, I'll just move on with the current debugger,
                        incrementally improving it where it makes sense. But I
                        have to be careful not to get caught up in sunk cost
                        fallacy. If the language grows less reliant on a
                        debugger, and that debugger becomes a burden, I might
                        need to scrap it for the time being.
