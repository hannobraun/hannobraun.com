                        >many problems</a> is the type system. This was the most
                        recent thing I worked on, and it was actually the
                        trigger for starting to think about a new prototype.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The previous prototype started out being untyped.
                        Meaning there wasn't <em>any</em>
                        type system, not even a dynamic one. Everything was just
                        a 32-bit number, similar to how Forth or assembly tend
                        to work. I devised this as a stopgap, to get the
                        language started without the initial need for designing
                        and building a type system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And it worked in that capacity! The prototype where I
                        first did this, was also the first that I managed to
                        build a somewhat complete game in. But it was also
                        limiting the language. Most importantly, it was
                        preventing code updates from working reliably. So I
                        started transitioning to a static type system with full
                        type inference, which turned out to be very difficult.
