                        as much as feasible, in a way that allows me to refine
                        it iteratively. Reason being, that I don't want to waste
                        any effort on making it better than it needs to be,
                        before it can be replaced by <a

                    <p>
                        I'd like to talk about my idea for approaching the code
                        update algorithm. But before I can do that, I think I
                        need to lay down some basics. First, the context that
                        the update algorithm exists in: Its output, and how that
                        output is going to be used. Then, some details about how
                        code is represented in the Caterpillar compiler, that
                        should allow the update algorithm to do what it's
                        supposed to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the code update algorithm is to determine
                        which pieces of code were replaced by other pieces of
                        code. If you have some old code, <code>a b c</code>, and
                        new code, <code>a x c y</code>, then you'd expect the
                        algorithm to output "<code>b</code> was replaced by
                        <code>x</code>" and "new code <code>y</code> added after
                        <code>c</code>", or something along those lines.
                        Tomorrow, I'm going to explain what the compiler does
                        with that information.
