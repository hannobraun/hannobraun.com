                        The Caterpillar runtime is a bytecode interpreter.
                        (Right now. Eventually, I want to compile Caterpillar
                        directly to WebAssembly, and later machine code.) It
                        executes instructions that are generated by the
                        compiler. Some of those instructions are quite
                        complicated, which is why the runtime
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-11-06"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >requires dynamic allocation</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want to replace these complicated instruction with
                        simpler ones, but that means the compiler needs to do
                        more work. Basically, the runtime tracks more
                        information than is strictly necessary, and this
                        information is processed by those complex instructions.
                        My goal is to track that information at compile-time
                        instead, so no more complex instructions are required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started with bindings (what many languages call
                        "variables"). I'd like to eliminate that concept from
                        the runtime entirely. To do that, I need to track the
                        arity (number of inputs and outputs) of every expression
                        at compile-time. But that is not as simple as it
                        initially seemed, because the arity of the
                        <code>eval</code> intrinsic depends on the arity of the
                        anonymous function it evaluates.
