                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        Of all the <a

                        >effects in Rust</a>, asynchrony is the most interesting
                        one. In a weird way, it's a step back from panics, as it
                        uses the return value again, to transport the effect. As
                        a result, any caller of an asynchronous function needs
                        to handle the effect. If it can't (because it's not
                        async itself), that's a pain. (That's called function
                        coloring.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But in every other way, it's more powerful, and much
                        closer to what a full effect system could look like.
                        Here, a function that triggers the effect can be
                        resumed. And while every caller needs to handle the
                        effect, strictly speaking, the language includes enough
                        magic to make it easy to just pass it on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In that way, handlers can be nested. A handler lower in
                        the call chain could decide which of two async functions
                        to resume next, for example. But if it doesn't want to
                        resume either right now, it can itself trigger the
                        "async" effect and let a handler higher up (and
                        eventually the global executor) decide what happens
                        next.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having looked at those ad-hoc effects, we can now
                        imagine a unified system that could cover all of them.
                        That's a topic for tomorrow though!
