                        something that I move on from once I think that the
                        project is ready to start attracting real users, then I
                        have to consider how to market Crosscut to game
                        developers. And I figure the best way to do that, is to
                        write actual games with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It would probably be ideal, if somebody else wrote those
                        games. Somebody who sees the potential in Crosscut and
                        is willing to invest heavily into using it. Somebody who
                        works closely with me, so their experience can make
                        Crosscut better. But I think it would be a flawed plan,
                        to expect this user to just show up.

                    <p>
                        I'd rather have a plan that's still likely to work, even
                        if I'm <em>not</em> lucky. Which means it's not an
                        option to wait around. I have to <em>become</em> that
                        user. I have to write those games myself.
