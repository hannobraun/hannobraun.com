                        >a static type system</a> for Caterpillar is not a
                        preposterous thing to do right now. The language is
                        still untyped, which was always going to be just a
                        placeholder. And interactivity, the language's central
                        premise, currently has a

                        So yeah, working on deploying games to websites would
                        still be more important, but I figured, let's just see
                        how hard this can be. And since my plan is to center
                        Caterpillar's type system around <a

                        >type inference</a>, I didn't want to design a type
                        declaration syntax as a stopgap. How hard can a
                        <em>fully inferred</em> static type system really be?
                        Down the rabbit hole I went.

                        And as it turns out, <em>most of it</em> isn't that
                        hard. I had a compiler pass working quite quickly, that
                        can infer the types of most expressions. But there's one
                        <em>very</em> tricky part, and that's type inference of
                        recursive function calls. I'm still working on that.
