                        I think one key element to making upgrades easy, is the
                        ability to mix and match different versions of the
                        dependency you upgrade (which could be a library, the
                        language's standard library, or the language itself).
                        Being able to mix and match different versions of the
                        language is interesting (and Rust editions kind of allow
                        that), but I'd like to talk about libraries today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rust does a pretty good job here too, as you can have
                        multiple versions of the same library in your dependency
                        graph (as both transitive or direct dependencies). But
                        this is not without problems and can require

                        >Unison</a> has a more fine-grained, and I think
                        probably better, approach to this. All code is
                        content-addressed, which means even if types come from
                        different versions of a dependency (or even completely
                        different libraries), they are compatible as long as
                        they are actually the same.
