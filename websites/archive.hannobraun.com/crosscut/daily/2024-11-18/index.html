                        Quite a while ago, I talked about
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-04-18"

                        >rewinding your running program</a>. More recently, I
                        expanded on that, by looking at coarse-grained,
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-11-04"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >event-based rewinding</a> again. Today, I'd like to
                        take revisit fine-grained, expression-based rewinding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, let's talk about the difference in nomenclature,
                        because I was calling this "instruction-based" rewinding
                        before. Back then, it didn't make much of a difference,
                        since expressions in the compiler and instructions in
                        the runtime were pretty much the same thing. But as the
                        compiler is getting smarter, and the runtime is getting
                        simpler, those concepts have started to diverge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expressions are what the developer is concerned with and
                        (hopefully) understands, while instructions are an
                        implementation detail. So it makes more sense to base
                        fine-grained rewinding on expressions rather than
                        instructions. Next, I'd like to talk about how to
                        implement that.
