                        I used to run the Snake game all the time during
                        development, to test my changes. I tended to forget to
                        run the test suite, so sometimes I noticed it had broken
                        it at some point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The test suite has grown significantly <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-07-27"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >since then</a>, and I've come to rely on it for
                        day-to-day development. Now I forget to test the game,
                        and sometimes notice I have broken that. Which just
                        means that the test suite needs to grow even more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now, things are fine as they are. But at some point,
                        I need a real CI/CD pipeline that also compiles (maybe
                        even runs?) the available game code, to make sure it is
                        working. I want to be able to deploy changes to a
                        release channel right away, without the need for manual
                        testing. And despite that, a high confidence that
                        nothing will break.
