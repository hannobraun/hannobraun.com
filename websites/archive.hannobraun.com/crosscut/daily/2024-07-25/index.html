                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        >Implementing <code>if</code></a> was more difficult
                        than I expected. Which probably says more about my
                        estimation abilities than the difficulty of implementing
                        <code>if</code>. But either way, it required more
                        sophistication from the compiler than it had before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Previously, the code was pretty flat and linear. Now,
                        with blocks of code being passed to <code>if</code>,
                        there's a lexical hierarchy to it. This required some
                        changes to the intermediate representation. I knew from
                        a previous prototype that content-addressed code
                        fragments would do the job (and are necessary for
                        interactive programming anyway), so I just implemented
                        that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Those blocks of code also needed to be able to refer to
                        bindings from their parent scope, so I implemented
                        lexical scoping and made those blocks full closures.
                        This was probably a bit more than was necessary right
                        now, but I ran with it. We'll need closures anyway,
                        sooner or later, and now we have them.
