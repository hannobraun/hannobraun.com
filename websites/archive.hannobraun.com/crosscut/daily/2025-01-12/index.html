                        There's an obvious way to address
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-11"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >the problem of the code database</a> in the new
                        prototype: Just include it from the beginning. And
                        that's what I've been doing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I initially planned to implement the <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-12-31"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >"checkout" model</a>, because that seems easier and
                        allows for reusing existing editors. I had also planned
                        to include a debugger again (more on that later), but
                        this time built in a very minimal way; using some shitty
                        command-line interface that can render code and parse
                        simple commands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But before I had the opportunity to go down that road, I
                        looked at the shitty CLI I was planning, and had another
                        one of my "how hard could it be" moments: Could I just
                        implement <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-03"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >a whole editor</a> this way? So that's what I've been
                        trying to do. I already started regretting it. But now I
                        seem to be over that first hump, and the sailing is
                        smooth again. For now.
