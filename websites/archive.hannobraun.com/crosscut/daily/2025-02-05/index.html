                        Okay, so I went over the <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-10"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >problems of the old prototype</a>, and explained how I
                        intend to address most of them. What I left out, was the
                        syntax and evaluation model, because just as I started
                        to write about that,
                        <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2025-01-25"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >my plans changed</a>. I tried to go with a tried and
                        true approach but then... couldn't.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that this is, at the same time, a big weakness
                        and a big strength of mine. I just don't know how to do
                        the boring thing, if I think there may be a better way.
                        In this case, I saw how the tried and true approach
                        wasn't great for Crosscut. Meanwhile, I had come up with
                        an alternative model. So now I'm working on that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe I'll look back at this in a few months, and call
                        it over-ambition. It wouldn't be the first time. But the
                        fact is, my new model looks promising. There are no open
                        questions at this point. It's not clearly a bad idea. So
                        I'll try. And if it doesn't work, I'll try something
                        else.
