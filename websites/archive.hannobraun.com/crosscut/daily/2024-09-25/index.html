                        I'm currently working code update implementation, with
                        the goal of making code updates more reliable. I <em
                        >thought</em> I had this pretty much figured out in an

                        >earlier prototype</a> (with some adaptations required,
                        because that prototype ran everything in a single
                        process). Turns out, this isn't really the case. I must
                        have had a bit of tunnel vision.

                        That old implementation is much more limited than I
                        thought it was, and there's still lots to figure out to
                        make it practical. So I'm back to the drawing board. I'm
                        getting there. But working on this again, and having
                        talked about the

                        >custom editor</a>
                        lately, doing this based on text files strikes me as
                        deeply suboptimal.

                        To perform a successful code update, the compiler needs
                        to figure out exactly what changed, so it can generate
                        code to transition from the old version to the new. And
                        the editor already had that information, but then threw
                        it away. This would be much easier, if we didn't have to
                        reconstruct those changes by comparing their end
                        results.
