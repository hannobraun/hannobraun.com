                        It is well-known in business circles that
                        business-to-consumer (B2C) tends to be a harder model
                        than business-to-business (B2B). Businesses make money
                        (that is their purpose; otherwise they'd be hobbies or
                        startups). If they have a problem, they can often
                        connect that to a number, in cost or unrealized revenue.
                        A solution to such a problem has value.

                        Consumers are different. (I don't like the word
                        "consumer" in this context, since users of programming
                        languages are creators. I'll call them "private buyers"
                        from here on.) If something makes them 10% more
                        effective, they can't connect that to a monetary value.
                        This makes them more price-sensitive.

                        "Higher prices" might sound greedy, but it can be a
                        matter of survival for a small business like mine. If I

                        could charge 100â‚¬ per month for a seat, I don't need to
                        sell (and support) that many. If I sell it for 5â‚¬ to 10â‚¬
                        one-time, I need thousands of sales per year. And that
                        might simply be out of reach.
