                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        I have big ideas about what Caterpillar could be one
                        day. I jokingly call that my 20-year vision, although
                        I'm not sure I have it in me, to work on this project
                        for the next 20 years. (But who knows.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rust has been my primary language for the last 9-10
                        years. Naturally that colors my perception of what a
                        language can be, and maybe should be. And Rust has some
                        very attractive properties: It can run almost anywhere;
                        it provides low-level access, but allows you to build
                        safe abstraction on top; and it promotes robust software
                        by preventing a lot of mistakes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But also, I realize that Rust already exists. I don't
                        need to make another one. And what Rust lacks, is
                        immediate feedback. I want to build an interactive
                        programming language first, and then see how far I can
                        take it. If the answer ends up being, not quite far
                        enough to be as universal, low-level, or robust as Rust,
                        then so be it. Immediate feedback comes first.
