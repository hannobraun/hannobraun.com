                        At this point, I was going to start presenting the
                        approach to data types that I've come up with, which I
                        think comes closer to the ideal of being
                        <a

                        >simple, orthogonal, and composable</a> than what Rust
                        currently has. As I've been working on my drafts,
                        however, I realized that we're missing some more
                        background to tie some of it together: modules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My ideas on how modules should work are still somewhat
                        vague, which is I why I wasn't planning to go into them
                        right now. But let's do a quick dip, just enough to move
                        on with data types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, what's a module? It is something that exists
                        statically, meaning it is known to the compiler. It has
                        inputs (other modules it depends on), and it has outputs
                        (types, functions, and other items that it exports).
                        That sounds pretty much like a function to me. A
                        function that is executed at compile time!
