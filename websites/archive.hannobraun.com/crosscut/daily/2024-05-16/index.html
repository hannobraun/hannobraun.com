                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                    <p>
                        When it comes to Caterpillar, I think about my
                        priorities in terms of goals and risks. I want to create
                        a better way to develop software. I've chosen to explore
                        interactive programming as the means for doing that. So
                        what are the biggest risks, that would prevent me from
                        achieving this goal?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right now, I think the biggest risk is that I fiddle
                        around endlessly, making progress and feeling
                        productive, without necessarily ending up with something
                        useful. So I've decided to focus down on a single use
                        case, a simple game, and only do what is necessary to
                        make writing that game in Caterpillar possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game runs natively on my local machine, because that
                        was easiest to get started with. That means even a
                        finished and fun game won't curb that top risk, because
                        a game running just on my computer is still not really
                        useful. So I think the next step after the game is
                        finished, might be to make it run in the browser.
