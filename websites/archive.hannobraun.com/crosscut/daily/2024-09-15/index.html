                        before Crosscut was called Crosscut</a>! If it refers to
                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                        So why do I want <a
                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-09-14"

                        >a custom editor</a>? The core goal of Caterpillar is to
                        create an immediate connection between the developer and
                        their code. Just the language, the compiler and runtime,
                        can't achieve that by themselves. They need to be
                        assisted by tools that are built around them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The custom tooling that I imagine would be kind of a
                        hybrid between an editor and a debugger. Something that
                        gives you the means to edit your code, but then also
                        loads that code into the running program immediately,
                        and shows you what is happening as the result of your
                        changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think language servers, as currently implemented for
                        common languages and IDEs, already get us part of the
                        way there. But aside from the interactivity aspect, the
                        direct manipulation of a running program, there are
                        things that language servers (as far as I've seen) don't
                        currently provide, which I want to have.
