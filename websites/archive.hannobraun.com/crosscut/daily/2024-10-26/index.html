                        meantime, I've come up with two objective reasons why a

                            href="/crosscut/daily/2024-10-24"

                        >switch to microcontroller firmware</a> would be
                        detrimental.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, it would delay anything else that needs to get
                        done. Probably not too badly. A few weeks, maybe, most
                        of that to teach the tooling how to deal with a
                        microcontroller. But still, on the game development
                        side, I have a perfectly fine (if basic) testbed for
                        additional improvements to the language and tooling,
                        right now. And those are among my top priorities.

                    <p>
                        Second, and maybe more importantly, it would be
                        inherently less demo-able. Once things are ready for
                        that, I want a live demo to be front and center on the
                        website. I can't expect every visitor to have a dev
                        board at the ready. Nor will I always have one with me,
                        when I want to quickly show someone the project. Games
                        can run on websites and on my phone. Firmware can't.
