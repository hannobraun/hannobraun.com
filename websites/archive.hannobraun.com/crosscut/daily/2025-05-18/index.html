                        I have two more notes on postfix syntax in the pipeline.
                        But first, I'd like to stop for some updates:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I implemented bindings! For now, only in the form of
                            function parameters. But using an anonymous function
                            that you evaluate immediately, it should be possible
                            to simulate <code>let</code> bindings. I plan to add
                            those as syntax sugar later.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This means that recursion (which has been in the
                            language for a while) should now actually be usable.
                            Before, it was possible to write recursive
                            functions, but I struggled to actually do something
                            with that.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To simplify things in advance, I moved function
                            resolution to runtime, making the language much more
                            dynamic. Not the direction I want to go in, but I
                            think it's what I need right now: A much simpler
                            compiler and less complexity overall, making it
                            easier to make progress where it matters most.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I had some trouble accommodating the expanded syntax
                        tree required for this. For a while, I went down the
                        wrong path there, making things way too complicated. In
                        the end, I realized that a much simpler, less type-safe,
                        uniform syntax node representation would work better; so
                        that's what I went with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I <em>should</em> be doing now is verify that
                        recursion is <em>actually</em> usable, and use that to
                        write a test which demonstrates the lack of live code
                        updates (or hot reloading; whatever nomenclature we end
                        up going with). That's the next priority, as I want to
                        build everything else around a
                        <a

                    <p>
                        What I did instead, was sucker myself into doing some
                        code cleanups. This is important too. After all, getting
                        to terms with the shape of that thing I'm writing; the
                        code database, the incremental-only compiler that it
                        implies, the editor that drives that; is a constant
                        struggle. And maybe it also serves as a bit of a break
                        for me.
