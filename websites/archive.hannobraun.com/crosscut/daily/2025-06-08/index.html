                        So yeah, I'm starting to develop games, mostly in Rust,
                        using Crosscut where I can. Over the last week or so, I
                        already laid out how I got to that decision. But there's
                        another line of though that kinda ran in parallel, which
                        also swayed me towards taking games as a use case for
                        Crosscut more seriously.

                        A while ago, I started looking into some established
                        game engines and frameworks, just to get a better feel
                        for what's out there. Until then, my frame of reference
                        for what a competitive game engine needs to be, was
                        along the lines of <a
                            href="https://godotengine.org/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >Godot</a> or <a
                            href="https://defold.com/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >Defold</a>. Making something comparable to those, would
                        require a lot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But then I tried <a
                            href="https://love2d.org/"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >LÃ–VE</a>, which opened my eyes to the possibilities.
                        Because it's such a simple thing, and yet people make <a

                        >very successful</a> games with it. If there are
                        developers who prefer simple engines and produce such
                        great games, then maybe I have a chance to serve that
                        market successfully.
