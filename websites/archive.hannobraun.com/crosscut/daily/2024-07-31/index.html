                        >code could get auto-parallelized in the pre-compilation
                            step</a>. I'm not sure if that's a good idea, but it
                        certainly is a fascinating one. Anyway, if it were to
                        happen, some open questions would need to be addressed.
                        For example, to make a <em>good</em> decision on what to
                        parallelize, the compiler needs knowledge of the
                        specific hardware to target. Which won't be available in
                        pre-compilation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe a project can define a number of profiles to
                        represent different platforms it supports, and the
                        developer switches between them to view the different
                        ways their code could end up being parallelized. But
                        that might be confusing and maybe not that useful. But
                        having the option to see how it looks on a specific
                        target (maybe to look into a specific bug) would
                        certainly be useful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or maybe the compiler just splits the code into
                        parallelizable packets, which then get scheduled at
                        runtime. That would be more flexible, but also carry
                        some overhead. And we'd be back to the developer not
                        understanding the runtime behavior of their application.
                        Definitely lots of details to figure out before this can
                        happen, if it ever does.
