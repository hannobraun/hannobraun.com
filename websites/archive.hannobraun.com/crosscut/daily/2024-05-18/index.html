                    "Caterpillar", that is the old name, just so you know.

                    <p>
                        As I've explained before, the core question of the
                        current prototype is, whether a debugger is a practical
                        option to tame even a simplistic and confusing language.
                        If that's the case, then I can use Caterpillar in
                        earnest from early on, while the language is growing
                        slowly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Early signs have been good, but the development of the
                        prototype is still a bit of a back and forth: I'll make
                        some progress on the game, then I run into a problem
                        that takes too much effort to understand, so I improve
                        the debugger until understanding the problem becomes
                        easy. I just went through another debugger improvement
                        phase, and here's how it looks right now:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img
                            src="debugger.png"
                            alt="A screenshot of a browser window containing Caterpillar's debugger"
                        />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's a bit easier to see where you're currently at in
                        the code, and there are "Step" and "Continue" buttons to
                        better control the program. I won't consider this
                        prototype successful (i.e. the core question answered)
                        until I've made a full game with it, but I continue to
                        be happy with the progress.
